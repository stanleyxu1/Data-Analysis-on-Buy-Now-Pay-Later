t5_2qstm,Credit Implications of AfterPay,"Credit Implications of AfterPay Hello, to begin, I recently paid off my first car loan. My credit score increased a bit; however, I want to continue building it up through the rest of my twenties (24M). Can I utilize various services such as Affirm or PayPal for larger purchases as a way to continue steadily building? Would they build credit with the payments over time? I suppose am conflating my auto loan experience with these services, so I am seeking clarification from this sub. For example, if I wanted this one product that is $1200 and the seller offers Affirm pay in 4, how would that impact me both in the short term and long term? Thank you in advance for your knowledge, advice, and hospitality. ",[1200.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15e9pbl/credit_implications_of_afterpay/
t5_2qstm,Is Afterpay okay?,"Is Afterpay okay? I tend to use my credit cards for everyday purchases like groceries, especially because groceries are the main way I rack up points. However, when I buy clothes online I like to use Afterpay when I can because I can budget my clothing spending out really easily and it just automatically puts into perspective for me that if I really want a certain item of clothing I'll be paying $40 every 2 weeks for example. 

It's also no interest and I don't miss payments even accidentally because it just automatically takes it from my account. I go grocery shopping on a pretty regular schedule so I usually remember to pay the balance after but for online shopping it's pretty irregular so I'm kind of willing to deal with the fact that Afterpay doesn't build credit in exchange for the convenience of it. 

I find it weirdly mentally helpful to buy myself a really nice item of clothing I've been wanting and then have that reminder that's like ""yeah you really wanted this but you are still paying it off for four more weeks!"" and it makes me less likely to impulse buy because I think ""oh but there's still two more payments on the last thing I bought.."" Even if I can always comfortably pay for it outright Afterpay is like forced accountability for me because I have to think about whether or not the item is worth taking like a month to pay off... but I don't want to do that on a credit card with interest. 

Is this weird? Thoughts?",[40.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/p5b8tr/is_afterpay_okay/
t5_2qstm,Using BNPL loans from Affirm/Afterpay to invest?,"Using BNPL loans from Affirm/Afterpay to invest? I've been furnishing a new apartment and seeing a lot of options to take on interest and fee free loans from Afterpay or Affirm. Some of these loans drag on for as long as 18 months. Again, all no interest or fee.

I don't understand. I feel like I should just take advantage of these terms, stick the money into VOO, VTI, and maybe some crypto. And then pay them back.

These are a few thousand dollars and I'm a single man in his late 20s earning $180,000 base and I have a healthy emergency fund.

t5_2qstm,credit card has ruined my life,"credit card has ruined my life in august of last year, i got approved for a paypal credit card with a $2,000 line. i make about $8,000 a year, i’m 19 and self employed so my finances are shaky. sometimes i have really good months but i generally do not make an income that can justify having a $2,000 line of credit. i have no idea how or why i got approved for it but i did. from august-october, i used it for a handful of big purchases. i do not need to be told that this was irresponsible because i am more than aware. i know. it will not help me now so please save it. 


i accidentally sent money to the wrong person for one of those purchases and in getting that money back, paypal cleared my balance. so i spent some more of it until paypal took what i had spent prior to it being wiped, added what i had spent after it being wiped together and gave me $2,600 in debt. now it’s up to $3,666 and i have a payment of $430 due. i haven’t paid it because i have not made enough money at one given time to be able to pay that. that’s what i make in a decent month. i’ve been hoping it would be sent to collections so i can negotiate it but it’s been nearly a year and so far nothing. i have had a lot of money stolen by/through paypal before so my bank account no longer allows me to make payments through paypal, so i can’t pay this off if i wanted to. 

i am beyond in over my head with this debt. i am completely overwhelmed and have a panic attack every time i check paypal. i cannot get approved for another credit card, affirm, klarna, afterpay even for emergencies. i attempted to take out an emergency loan for a personal issue and it was denied because of this credit card. i have another credit card that i make all payments on on time/early, i barely even use it but my credit score is still horrific (460😬) because of this card.

what do i do? how am i supposed to dig myself out of this hole? i’m terrified and it terrifies me more to think about but i need to get this taken care of so i dont have this bullshit card haunting me forever.

I have been kicked out of home about 3 months ago and spent a full 2 months homeless while paying $125 a week for loans/phone payments

Was making about $700 a week at my first job and another $300 a week on my second (after tax)

About a month ago I finally got my own place and my work has been fully aware of my living situation, the only reason why I got my place is due to them telling the real-estate that they guarantee my income... My rent is $460 a week and I have 2 other people moving in with me soon to pay rent (in a month or 2)

I had to pull out another loan for emergencies which I may not talk about and in total my debts are;

-$10000 personal
-$7000 vehicle
-$2100 afterpay

My work has decided they don't wish to pay me for my services and have cut my hours by about 25 a week leaving me with $455 after tax, my loan repayment is $115 a week and my after current is $500 for the next 2 weeks, after that they are $200 or less

I am left with nothing after each payday and having to rely on my partner to help me with my payments??? How screwed is that

I don't have the vehicle anymore and require one for my second job now, I only just got out of being in a tough situation and feel as I am back in another one!!

t5_2qstm,Does PayPal affect my credit score long term?,"Does PayPal affect my credit score long term? So I just had a bit of an argument with my (20f) mom (47f). We got on the topic of money and my mother is a saleswoman, and has always just generally had a general belief that spending money that isn't yours is just a bad idea in general, which I agree with. She uses nothing but her debit card and cash when purchasing things. She's never even signed up for a credit card once in her life or ever taken out a loan that wasn't a mortgage or student loans. 

She's *very* persistent about these things, and honestly, I agree with her 99% of the time. I've never taken a loan (except student loans ofc), I rarely ever borrow money from friends even, and only once in my life have I ever used anything like AfterPay (it was once, I never missed a payment, but I didn't like it and unless I'm in a desperate emergency I highly doubt I'll ever use it again). I'm not really interested in a credit card ever, though I've learnt plenty online on how to use one to build up your credit score so maybe way down the future I might consider getting one. 

Now, where the argument comes in. The one thing I do use, however, is PayPal when I shop online. I got it first when I was 16 when my bank wouldn't allow me to get even a debit card at the time and all I use it for ever since then is merely use it as ""middleman"" of sorts. Now that I do have a debit card I don't want to give my information out to different websites, only on platforms I trust and for whatever reason PayPal isn't an option. So I prefer using PayPal; I have it connected to my bank account and when I want to buy things online I pay through that. It simply serves as the bridge between my money and whatever online shop I use it on; I've never used credit, I have never used the ""Bill Me Later"" option. I use nothing but my own money when I use it. Only once in my life have I ever gotten a negative balance on PayPal (only $40), but that was due to some error on PayPal's part for disconnecting my bank account for some reason. Once I called support and got it sorted, it was fine again.

I basically use it the same way as a person would with a debit card. I prefer using PayPal because if a site doesn't offer it as a payment option, except Amazon, I'm less likely to trust it, and my mom has only proven this point to me in the past by getting scammed online and having to close her old card and get a new one. If on the off chance I do get scammed online, as it did happen once, I feel more comfortable knowing I paid with PayPal because then I can get my money back by opening a dispute. 99% of my refunds go directly back to my bank account anyway, I can count on my hand the times money staying within my PayPal balance. Most of the times I just move it back to my bank account if it happens. 

The reason the argument happened was because, off hand I mentioned I use PayPal when I shop online, and I use it to pay my phone and internet bill. I like using it. I recommend to my friends to use it the way I do. She went absolutely *spastic* on me, telling me to close my account, that it's awful to use, that it will affect my credit score and that if maybe I stop *now* I might be fine when I'm 25. When I asked her to explain how it's bad she kept lumping it in with services like AfterPay, zipPay, credit cards, etc---things I understand how they can be bad, but when I asked her why specifically PayPal is awful, she'd just tell me I'm naive and ""it just is!"" and would go on about how it appears bad to banks and so on. I ignored her and did some of my own research; it could be bad if you use PayPal credit. It could be bad if you use the Bill Me Later option. They can check your credit score if you have a Premium or Business account, or that if you owe money to PayPal (such as the negative balance) it could come across as a debt eventually. I'm starting to think she just confused it with the PayPal Credit thing, because I couldn't find *anything* on how it could affect a person's credit score if they use PayPal simply as a transaction tool as I do. 

But I'm no expert, so that's why I'm asking reddit. Can PayPal affect your credit score in the long term if you simply use it as a transaction tool like a debit card?",[40.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/gx4psq/does_paypal_affect_my_credit_score_long_term/
t5_2qstm,"Rent is Most of My Income, but I'm in College","Rent is Most of My Income, but I'm in College Hi!

I've (20F) been a long time lurker on this sub and I've learned a lot about budgeting and finances. I'm a sophomore in college and recently (in August) moved into a flat with 3 other roommates. We live downtown in a major city where we all go to college.

I work about 15-20 hours (usually 20) a week at $10 an hour. I really love my job, I work at a doggy daycare and have been there for about a year, it's somewhere I'm able to go and have fun for part of the day. $60 every paycheck get directly pulled out of my paycheck and go straight to paying my student loan, which I believe is more than the minimum. My rent is $510 a month per person, which is cheap compared to other living situations around here. Most people who pay similar rent are sharing a room. We're lucky enough to all have our own, decent sized rooms.

I started using YNAB a couple months ago and have been tracking my expenses, but sometimes find it hard to stay within my budget. The way I use it is I try to budget out this months needed expenses (rent (utilities included), internet, groceries, Afterpay bills, and my cat) as well as next months  needed expenses, before I allow myself to budget for things like beauty, alcohol, dining out.

I also have some savings going. I'm trying to reach that first $1000 in emergency fund, and I'm also putting money away for when I want to buy a car. I wouldn't buy one that I'd need to pay monthly. I was going to try to save around $3,000-$5,000 for an older, but good car, but at the rate I'm going it'll take me like 8 years. All my classes are online, and I usually bike to work (\~5 min) or walk (\~15 min). I plan on using the bus in the winter this year when it gets really harsh.

My question is this:

I don't work very much because I'm in school full time. I really believe if I were to pick up more hours, it might interfere with my grades. I already don't do too hot in school because of the workload, along with depression and anxiety that seem to find a way to mess up everything I do. I recently started taking anti-depressants and trying therapy to see how I can work with it, but it's not an immediate fix.

When I read about how much rent should be of your income, it's usually 30% of your income. Mine is roughly 90%. Almost all of the money I make goes into paying rent. I tried googling some tips on what to do if your rent is over 30% of your income, but most articles talk about your rent being 50% of your income, and mine is so much more than that. Could the money I'm making every week be better put towards something else? Should I pick up more hours and deal with low grades because of it? I was really excited to move out of my parent's house and start living like an independent, but my finances are stressing me out the point where I won't eat sometimes because I'm afraid to not have money for groceries and I don't know what to do.

t5_2qstm,An app that steals your money,"An app that steals your money I made a mistake by downloading an app called ""QuadPay"". It's similar to Afterpay and Klarna in that it promises to help you by breaking up any payment into 4 equal installment payments that you pay every 2 weeks.

Problem was, I purchased an item from an online retailer only to find out a week later that there was a ""problem processing my order"" and it never actually went through, so the online merchant apologized and issued a refund.

Quadpay still charged me for the purchase (plus convience fees they add to each installment payment) and debited my account. The original merchant told me that a full refund had been issued, but Quadpay never refunded me.

The company has no phone number and their ""email support"" link on the app only gets you an automated response every time you contact them.

I made the worse mistake of trusting them that my refund would go through and tried to purchase a gift on Amazon using Quadpay a second time.

Same thing happened. Amazon declined the ""Quadpay ghost card"" and charged my personal debit card instead. 

But Quadpay still took money out of my account and set me up for more installments to be withdrawn.

So far they've stolen $58 from me and I have no idea how to get my money back and report this fraud, they took it from my PayPal account and are saying I still owe them more and more money which they auto debit from my account.",[58.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dky815/an_app_that_steals_your_money/
t5_2qstm,"Travelling around the country indefinitely, do I leave with debt or savings?","Travelling around the country indefinitely, do I leave with debt or savings? I'm going travelling around Australia next month for at least a year or longer with my partner. We currently have just over $7,000 AUD saved up, but roughly $2.5k in debt and will be expecting at least another $1k to come out for getting a car service, afterpay, etc. 



We'll have a steady income stream of roughly $700 a fortnight from student centrelink payments, and expect to get at least $4k (fingers crossed) before we leave from selling our cars, tax returns, selling other items, etc. The credit card debt has 55 days interest free on purchases and we've been paying it off gradually without being hit from interest due to staggering our purchases. 


In a nutshell, I'm wondering: is it better to pay the roughly $3.5k debt due now and leave with less savings but no debt? Or would it be better to leave with debt and more savings? The money coming in from student payments is pretty much guaranteed but the government here is quick to stop your payments suddenly if they don't think something is right. I've calculated that $12k would be sufficient for a year's travel, so $1k/month = $250/wk. I guess I'm just worried that something may happen and we need the savings, where as once you pay the credit card then that money is gone.

We’re probably pulling in about $4k post tax per fortnight, and although we don’t have much savings we’ve basically put a lot of that income into living comfortably and visiting hardware shops (Bunnings) to improve the house so once we tighten the old belt and stop spending, we will probably get a fair nest egg set up. In regards to debt we’ve got a few thousand on a credit card, and a 2 year old mortgage with repayments of approx $1250 per month, that we’re about $8k ahead thanks to paying extra each month, nothing else except for a bit of Afterpay that’ll be gone in a month or two.

t5_2qstm,Assistance with savings,"Assistance with savings I apologise if this is the wrong thread. 

Long time lurker; first time posting. From Australia. :)

&#x200B;

Hello all, 

So, basically my dilemma is just wondering how I can properly budget to save and essentially be in a surplus each month. I guess I'll start with what payments I'm currently paying off that I'd like to pay before the end of the year:

iPhone XS Max (This is on Apple's 12 month interest-free program) I've already put down 500 dollars on the account \~ 1,299 left to pay. I'd like to pay this off before the end of the year so I'd start 2019 on a new slate if possible. 

In Australia, we have a service deemed AfterPay, basically where applicable, allows a consumer to pay off products over an 8 week period; fortnightly payments. (No interest is accumulated or added past 8 weeks, except for a late fee); I have a chair I purchased as my other one was just killing my back that I bought for $260. The first payment for $65 is due next week. 

I also had to build my own PC as mine was shitting itself so I used a service called ZipMoney that has 6 months interest-free on the purchase of my own custom parts. I currently have 285 dollars remaining and the interest-free period ends next year in February. Direct Debited from my account is $100 p/m.  

&#x200B;

Yes, quite a few needs paying off as I'm embarrassed to admit. 

&#x200B;

The only major payment I have is for my car which is around $1,000 p/m. I make around $2800-3200 per month. The car payments are fine, they're not killing me; I'm comfortably paying it. Insurance is around an extra $200 p/m.

&#x200B;

Due to few bad decisions with my spending habits, I'm now below 1k in savings. I do get paid in a few days which is the good part. 

&#x200B;

I'm not stressing over any payments that I currently have going on, just like to get tips on how to save and what to pay off first/quickly.

&#x200B;

Thanks so much for reading, guys.

t5_2qstm,Making a purchase via Klarna... but it is telling me that I will pay 0% (0.00%APR) interest for 24 months? What's the catch?,"Making a purchase via Klarna... but it is telling me that I will pay 0% (0.00%APR) interest for 24 months? What's the catch? Hi guys.  I'm trying to make a $2700 purchase online, but I want to make installments on the payments. The seller I'm trying to buy from offers the Klarna option, so I clicked through the app to see what the offer would be.

For a purchase of $2700, it offered me a payment option of 24 or 48 months, at 0 -29.99% APR. When I clicked the 24 month option, it then switched to 0.00% APR. 

So the plan is: *24 payments of $112.08 at 0% APR.* 

*Order amount\* - $2,690.00*  
*Total interest (0.00% APR) - $0.00*  
*Total cost - $2,690.00*  
*Pay today -$0.00*

My question: what is the catch? Is it truly just 24 monthly payments of $112 at no interest? It seems too good to be true. Why would Klarna not be charging me interest? My credit score is like 760, so is that why?

How are Klarna and the actual retailer benefiting from this? Do they just bank on people not making payments? Or charging people with lower credit interest?

If anyone has experience with Klarna, it would be appreciated.","[2700.0, 2700.0, 112.08, 2690.0, 0.0, 2690.0, 0.0, 112.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15mojf8/making_a_purchase_via_klarna_but_it_is_telling_me/

I'm trying to figure out if it would be smart to take out a personal consolidation loan for my credit cards. I make just about **$2,800** a month after taxes, working **fulltime 7 days a week**. (I also donate plasma occasionally when my body can handle it, but it isn't a “reliable” income and I could get deferred at any time...)

I am currently a college student and will be starting an intense 15-month Nuclear Medicine program this fall. Due to MANDATORY 40-hours a week clinicals, this means at some point I will have to cut down my work hours and rely mostly on student loans to cover living expenses etc. The student loan debt is a sacrifice I am willing to make for my future, because Nuclear Medicine pay is quite literally 3-4x what I currently make at my entry-level job and I will be able to make bigger payments towards my debt. *I will still have a job while in the program, but I will be cutting down to PRN/part-time hours which means I will NOT be bringing home fulltime pay after around October of this year.* (This scares me a lot which is why I am in a panic to get my cards paid down before this fall so I have less payments per month to worry about.)

* A worry that I have is that due to my high credit card debt (my utilization is a very high %), I will not be able to be APPROVED for private student loans if I happened to need them.
* I am also scared that if I take out a consolidation loan NOW, I might not get approved for a private student loan if I happen to need one at some point. (My federal loans don't always cover my full tuition even when I take out the max amount.)

My FICO score is **622** so **I cannot get approved for a balance-transfer card. My credit card utilization is VERY HIGH as you will see below.**

I'm torn between a loan and paying it off quicker, or just continuing with the snowball method. (I 100% DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT CARDS ANYMORE AND WILL NOT BE USING THEM AGAIN AFTER PAYING THEM OFF.)

The loan I was pre-approved for is through Upgrade. $12,000.

* 5-year (60 months) loan: **$345.15**/month, **23.99%** interest rate, 29.35% APR (includes the one-time 9.99% origination fee)
* 3-year (36 months) loan: **$452.04**/month, **20.99%** interest rate, 28.90% APR (includes the one-time 9.99% origination fee)

Obviously I’m leaning towards the 36 month loan but the minimum payment is higher than what I currently pay for my minimums on my credit cards…. So am I stupid for even considering it? I can’t seem to get approved for any interest rates lower than 20%, but I’m hoping I might be able to refinance it sometime once my credit score improves.

I want to use this year in order to get my finances right and I want to see if I am able to document everything on the way to stay motivated. I have a total debt as of today 01/01/25 - $30,267.01 here is a quick rundown on what its composed of.

List of all known debt

* Bank of America = $1342.62 - 3%
* Klarna = $822.17 - no rate just need to pay off
* Camaro = $23,711.75 - 12%
* Capital one = $349.78 - 29%
* Golds gym = $188.24 - just haven't paid it no rate
* Planet Fitness = $51.66 just haven't paid it no rate
* Collections - T-Mobile = $215 - no rate in collections from 2020
* Insurance - Progressive = $362.97 - need to just pay no rate
* EOS fitness = unknown right now
* Fidelity loan = $1722.82 - 9.5%
* Salary Loan = $1500 - 10 installments of $150

As you can see its a lot of things with different things I owe and would like to know what would you start with if you had lets say $500

I make around $1500 working at $22/hr biweekly. I want to sell my car which was a big mistake but I would owe around $7000 for the rest of the car. Not sure if I should continue to pay it until I can save enough money to pay it or look for an alternative.

Anyways I would like you guys opinions in the mess that I am and hopefully get some good advice from this! thank youuuuu","[30267.01, 1342.62, 822.17, 23711.75, 349.78, 188.24, 51.66, 215.0, 362.97, 1722.82, 1500.0, 150.0, 500.0, 1500.0, 22.0, 7000.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hr9eql/day_1_of_trying_to_fix_my_financial_life/
t5_2qstm,Alternative to payday loans and other predatory lenders,"Alternative to payday loans and other predatory lenders Hey All - recently we gave a friend who is going through a rough patch a small loan of $750 to get him through until payday. He paid us back on time, as promised but I assume he’s going to find himself in exactly the same position next payday. We’ll lend him the money again since it’s a small amount and we’re fortunate enough that we won’t be in any kind of trouble if he can’t actually pay us back for a while. As I write this, we might just tell him to pay us back in a few months once he’s got himself some breathing room… but that isn’t the point of this post…

Is anyone aware of any alternatives to payday loans? Our friend had previously got caught up in that cycle and estimates he paid around $2k in fees and interest over the course of about 8 months. All this for continually borrowing <$1k until payday for a week at a time or so.

It seems as though there’s got to be something between the 5% to 10% interest of a personal loan for those who are well qualified and the 400% for those stuck with payday loans. If there isn’t, there should be! There has to be a business model that would allow you to take risky bets and charge 25% interest or somewhere around there.

Thoughts, anyone?","[750.0, 2.0, 1.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16sm1tn/alternative_to_payday_loans_and_other_predatory/

Basically, I want to buy a $3,000 machine and can pay for it just fine normally but it’s for my small business and would like to use my business card that was delayed in arriving due to some mail mixup.

They allow for Click Lease, Klarna, and Affirm and I’m sure one of these can do it but I’ve never used any of them before.

Basically, I want to pay the smallest possible amount now and then pay off the entire thing a week later with a different card without paying any penalties for paying it off early or a significant amount of interest.

Which of them is best for my purposes? Reading through their terms myself, I can’t tell, especially when they’re largely hidden behind “sign up and then we’ll tell you how it works”.

Thanks!

i accidentally sent money to the wrong person for one of those purchases and in getting that money back, paypal cleared my balance. so i spent some more of it until paypal took what i had spent prior to it being wiped, added what i had spent after it being wiped together and gave me $2,600 in debt. now it’s up to $3,666 and i have a payment of $430 due. i haven’t paid it because i have not made enough money at one given time to be able to pay that. that’s what i make in a decent month. i’ve been hoping it would be sent to collections so i can negotiate it but it’s been nearly a year and so far nothing. i have had a lot of money stolen by/through paypal before so my bank account no longer allows me to make payments through paypal, so i can’t pay this off if i wanted to. 

i am beyond in over my head with this debt. i am completely overwhelmed and have a panic attack every time i check paypal. i cannot get approved for another credit card, affirm, klarna, afterpay even for emergencies. i attempted to take out an emergency loan for a personal issue and it was denied because of this credit card. i have another credit card that i make all payments on on time/early, i barely even use it but my credit score is still horrific (460😬) because of this card.

what do i do? how am i supposed to dig myself out of this hole? i’m terrified and it terrifies me more to think about but i need to get this taken care of so i dont have this bullshit card haunting me forever.

t5_2qstm,StubHub stole from me and I have no idea what to do,"StubHub stole from me and I have no idea what to do Hi all,

Wondering if this community has any ideas on how I can escalate this and get my money back. 

I bought tickets to an event on StubHub through Klarna (third party entity that allows you to make four installment payments). StubHub delivered the tickets electronically, but for reasons I don’t understand they wouldn’t open on my phone and StubHub couldn’t resolve the issue before the event, meaning I missed it. This was especially upsetting because the tickets were a Christmas gift. 

Initially StubHub refused to reimburse me, saying it was the fault of whatever entity sent the tickets that they wouldn’t open. As such, I opened a dispute with Klarna to get reimbursed through them. The same day, StubHub backtracked and said they could reimburse me if I dropped the case with Klarna. I did the same day. 

Now, it has been over a month since I dropped the case and I keep getting the runaround every time I call StubHub.  They say they can’t reimburse me while there is a chargeback attempt on the account. I told them I dropped the dispute. I have called and emailed dozens of times, only to be told to be patient and the relevant department is working on a resolution. After another two weeks of radio silence from them, I emailed asking for an update and was told they were trying to replace the tickets.  What in the world?! I just had a baby a week ago. I can’t go to any event even if they did replace the tickets AND I never requested that happen. I want a reimbursement. 

I called Klarna today to reopen the dispute and they told me there was nothing they could do because the dispute window closed. They advised me to try calling my bank. The problem is, the payments were made via direct withdrawal/debit, so effectively have no protections. 

What do I do? How is this legal? StubHub just keeps doing nothing. I’m out almost $400 and that is money we could really use to pay hospital bills now that the baby is here. 

I’ve certainly learned a lesson and will never use Klarna or StubHub again.",[400.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ap1qiv/stubhub_stole_from_me_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to/

Will I ever get approved for credit again? 

Are there ways to improve my credit despite being bankrupt?

Will I be able to keep access to lines of credit that I already have access to like Affirm, Klarna, etc. I know using those apps are frowned upon but they come in handy when you need something in a pinch. 

What is court like? I’m actually scared to ask the lawyer this question. Do they make you take the stand and explain why you are in bankruptcy court or is it just a legal formality that doesn’t mean much?

I do not plan to buy a house in this area (the Greater New Orleans area) unless I hit the Powerball and can buy the house outright. But if I ever changed my mind, will I be approved for a mortgage?

Speaking of the lottery, if I hit the lottery, will the court take my money? Will they have to claim the money before I get the rest?

I have a bank account at a credit union where my car is financed. Will I be kicked out of the union?

The only items I have that are worth anything are my iPad and an automobile diagnostic scanner that I use to repair my brakes.  Neither are worth $500. Will I have to give those up?

Current 25 y/o, with roughly $30k of debt consisting of payday loans, a secured loan, credit cards and some balances for pay in fours (Klarna for example). I have one primary job, but I’ve accepted and scheduled to work a second. Every two weeks from my primary job I make roughly $1750, income from the second job is a potential $300 every week. 

Expenses come to around $1,800/mo, which includes $250/mo for the secured loan pay off, the rest is rent, utilities, etc. 

The secured loan sits at a $6.8k bal, all other debt have gone to collections. My goal is to pay off everything as soon as possible, I’m aiming for within 1-2 years. 

I’ve researched debt relief programs, came across National Debt Relief, but I understand some of the debts would not be accepted under the program (roughly $6k of the remaining $23.2k). I am also unsure if NDR accepts any debts that have been forwarded to collections agencies.

My tentative plan is to use $2k/mo for my debts not including the secured loan ($500/mo to NDR, $1500/mo to the debts not included in NDR). After the debts not included in the NDR have been paid off, I’m want to shift my monthly splits to $1k/mo for the debt relief, $1k/mo for the secured loan (in addition to the previously stated $250/mo). Once the secured loan is paid off, all $2k/mo to the debt relief program.

Please keep in mind I am only nineteen and I know I messed up very badly. Right now I am seeking advice not to be chastised. Thank you, now let's move forward.

I have a total of seven creditors I am in debt to. Three of them are credit cards, one is a personal loan, one is an auto loan (2013 BMW 750xi) and two are buy-now-pay-later (Specifically Klarna and Affirm) . Those two are not of any concern to me right now.

Total in debt: $39,533.77

I have zero issue with my USAA auto loan that is always my **first priority** and always gets paid on time but due to some really bad choices I have racked up a large amount of credit card debt. My monthly car insurance is $261 dollars monthly (I am insured with State Farm, I live in Illinois please let me know if you know of any cheaper insurance companies. I have tried all the other big insurers and they all quoted me over 500 a month. Geico, liberty mutual, Progressive, USSA.) I made the mistake of moving out too and in with my boyfriend. I do not pay rent with my boyfriend but I do help with groceries. Due to a large amount of tickets, some of which I can’t even pay, things have gotten out of hand with my finances and I want to rid myself of this debt. Unfortunately the snowball method is out of the picture now… I think…

So, the total in debt we are currently concerned about is, ***$12,511.01***

(I am currently at $15 an hour, I should be working 40 hours a week but usually it’s a little less.) I get paid roughly $900 every two weeks (After tax, usually before tax it’s $1,200). I used to get paid on a biweekly basis but just this past week I got changed to a semimonthly pay basis (15th and EOM).

I have heard of debt transfer credit card, but I fear I do not have a high enough credit score to get one that would help with my situation.

Experian: 570

Equifax: 584

TransUnion: 603

My credit score used to be at 749. It is insane to see how quickly that can change in only ONE year.

I am a complete imbecile, I know.

It started to go down when I would apply to finance cars. I don’t know if there is any way I can get those off my report, but I thought I would throw that out there if anyone has any advice on that part.

I want to just do a total debt consolidation with a loan, but as you can imagine it’s hard, near impossible to get a loan with a score such as mine. Websites that offer me loans with a credit score like mine seem sketchy and not trustworthy.

I have already ruled out debt relief companies, I know they are a scam. I also understand the snowball method, I had been trying that but it’s clear my expenses with credit cards surpass what my income is. I have been applying to jobs that work with my current work schedule, but I’m afraid it’s time for action. I am wondering if any of you know any creditors that would loan me money, debt consolidation institutions, anything that would help me.

If you suggest uber I encourage you to take a gander at my amazing fourteen miles to the gallon. My BMW is a thirsty V8. I refuse to sell her, it wouldn’t make sense due to it being on a loan.

As for my personal loan, that was made for a purchase of a 1991 Mazda Miata that now doesn’t work, and I am in the process of selling it. As of today, someone is meeting up with me to buy it for 2,000 dollars so that will help with the accounts that are delinquent. It’s quite unfortunate that I bought it for 5,000 dollars and have lost three grand on it but you win some you lose some. Hard to sell a 91’ with oil leaking into cylinder four for 5 g’s.

I've been in the market for a new laptop and I was saving up the cash for it, but 0% APR is basically the same as cash, and if I qualify for the offer I'm going to jump on it.

The complication: I was a victim of identity theft and my credit is as frozen as Antartica. So if I applied for anything I'd most certainly get immediately denied.

I contacted the company offering the 0% financing (Klarna) via email, and asked how they would need me to proceed. I got a phone call back the same day from a CSR who told me they deal exclusively with Experion, and that I'd need to unfreeze my credit about a week ahead of time before applying just to be on the safe side.

A simple online form and a $3 fee to unlock my credit for a week and a half later, and I'm good to go.

**Don't be afraid to contact a credit company ahead of time.** They want *your* business, and they'll be happy to let you know their process for checking credit. There are websites out there that sometimes list which credit bureau a certain company uses for a specific state, but you can always just... ask. It's frustrating for them to have a hard credit pull bounce because it's locked, too, and as the CSR explained, it can make things a lot more complicated if you attempt to apply before unlocking the security freeze.",[3.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8iet9c/if_your_credit_is_frozen_call_a_company_before/

Hi all, my husband (38m) passed away very suddenly on 2/4 and I’m slowly working to unwind some of our finances. My post history has one in askdocs explaining what happened, please look at that before asking me for details if you can help it… it’s really hard for me to keep writing about it because there are very few answers right now. Shortened version is he seems to have passed in a matter of minutes from sudden cardiac arrest, possibly triggered by an undiagnosed or newly developed arrhythmia.

My husband had a mattress and peloton financed through Affirm, but I haven’t been able to see a location on their site to alert them of his passing, or a number to call. I’m grieving pretty heavily so I may have missed it, but if anyone knows what I can do to let them know that would be incredibly helpful. 

Basically all of our bills are in my name, which makes some of this a lot easier. Even so, he has a small amount of credit card debt and these two small financed purchases (both ~ $1000/each based on texts his phone has gotten). 

He passed while driving home but did not crash, somehow amid what seems to be sudden/unexplained cardiac arrest he unconsciously hit his breaks and the car stopped before hitting anything, but his car insurance is still covering a number of final expenses including a death benefit. So that’s not an issue, thank goodness

t5_2qstm,Someone took out an Affirm loan in my name and it has been sent to collections,"Someone took out an Affirm loan in my name and it has been sent to collections About a month ago, I was checking my Credit Score on Credit Karma, excited because I anticipated an increased score since I paid off my credit card debt. To my surprise, my credit score decreased by 60 points because of two new collections from Affirm. Unbeknownst to me, there was a total loan amount of $708 fraudulently taken out under my name. 

I immediately did a search of my personal records and history and found that an Affirm account has been active under an email I no longer use. I initially forgot that I used Affirm once in 2017 to purchase a phone from Gazelle, but was issued a refund after I returned the item for being wrong.  After the unpleasant experience, I did not use Affirm or Gazelle again. 

Fast forward to 01/2020, I received an email from Affirm confirming a loan to Walmart Stores. Since then, I’ve been receiving emails from Affirm notifying me that “Auto-Pay failed.” Again, i no longer use this email address (I made this email back in middle school), so I was not initially aware of these emails. 

I immediately filled a dispute with TransUnion and Experian. I called Affirm to report the fraudulent charge and they gave me a case number and let me know someone from their fraud department would reach out. Well, I finally got word back and was told that the available information they have indicates I am responsible for the loans with Walmart and Gazelle (only the Walmart loan is shown in collections). I DID initiate a loan to Gazelle and have proof that it was refunded in full. I am NOT responsible for the loan with Walmart. Not to mention, I have never shopped online for Walmart. 

What can I do to prove the Walmart loan is not my responsibility and I did not authorize this transaction? Any advice would be great.

So my insurance doesn't really kick in until I reach my $6000 deductible. OK, fine. But dang! Having insurance doubled what I owe to the hospital!


Long story is, my doctor said I had to get some bloodwork. The receptionist told me to check out the lab in the hospital (1 minute walk from the doctor's front door). I'm dumb. I went. Mistake #1. I asked if they take my insurance, they said ""Heck yeah we do"". 5 minutes of bloodwork later and I'm driving home. (If I had not listened to the receptionist's advice and just driven to the lab down the street.........)


I get a bill in the mail 3 months later. The total bill is $1600. Since I don't have insurance (what?) they want $290. This is where I make mistake #2. I call the hospital's billing company and tell them ""Hey I have insurance, what the heck? Why am I being billed $290 for 5 minutes of bloodwork?"" They say ""Oh dear, looks like we took your insurance number down wrong. We'll put the payment on hold while we contact your insurance company."" *In hindsight I should have paid the $290!*


1 month passes. I get an updated bill in the mail. The total bill is $1600. Since I have insurance, they want $550. From me. My insurance, bless their hearts, got my bill down from $1600 to $550. **What?**


I called the billing company and asked if I could just pay the $290 from the original bill. ""Sorry! $550 please or we send it to collections!""


I called my insurance company and asked if they cared, at all, about any of this. They don't care.


Does anyone have any ideas? Am I screwed? Just pay the $550? Is there some magical word I have to say to the insurance person to get them to fight for the $290 rate?

t5_2qstm,"i took 6 months off work, and survived!","i took 6 months off work, and survived! Hi PF! 



In November last year, I decided that I would take extended time off work to spend time with my long distance (Transpacific) SO in California. I preferred unpaid leave because I believed it’d improve my chances with US Border Control (demonstrate intent to return home), and also since I would rather keep a bird on hand and my options open.



I managed to pull it off without burning a hole in my pocket, so maybe PF will enjoy my tale (all figures in USD)!



**Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork (aka, research and negotiate)**

I’d been working in a fairly large organization, where extended unpaid leave was rare, but did happen. There were no HR guidelines or formal process, so I dug around, speaking to people from HR, people who knew people who tried taking time off. I found out that taking time off “to accompany a spouse overseas on temporary assignment” had a high-hit-rate while bearing the closest resemblance to my own reasons. I also knew that I had some leverage including being generally high performing (and since HR was measured on negative attrition, they had a vested interest in keeping me from leaving).

So I made my request sound as close as I could to the proven narrative, while remaining factually accurate (in effect making it seem that my SO and I may be closer to getting married than we actually are). I also reiterated that I desired to stay and grow with the organization in the long term, but it was also balancing this intent against the shorter-term exigencies of being long distance with my SO (hinting that I would consider resigning as a last resort).

The process of getting support involved multiple conversations with supervisors and bosses, HR and higher levels of HR. It took weeks for me to get the approvals, and many more weeks to lock down an actual period and start date.

In the meantime, I read up on long-term visa options for the US, horror stories about US border control, etc. Alas, my visa bid for a longer-term (6 mth) visa was not granted (embassy staff said I would need to be visiting my family / spouse to qualify), which sent a $200 processing fee down the drain ☹. My only option was to enter the US on an ESTA, which meant staying 90 days at a time, and managing the risk of being denied entry by border control in subsequent visits.



**Phase 2: Making a Plan (aka budget like crazy)**

With a date in clearer sight, I was starting to crap my pants, because holy shit this is happening. I’d never been one for very detailed budgeting and tracking, but I knew this would be an expensive year, with only 4+ months of guaranteed income. On the upside, generally healthy PF habits have left me with no debt, an emergency fund, some money set aside for retirement/investments, and some liquid savings in various high-interest savings accounts. My financial goal was to make it through the year without drawing down on my savings. 

This was how I saw my financial situation:

***Guaranteed income for 2016***: ~$24,000 (4.5 months salary + bonuses from work last year)

***Budget for 2016***: $23,450

***Lumpy Expenses (Annual Budget)***

-	Flights & Related Costs: $4200 (2x long haul return flights)

-	Healthcare: $500

-	Clothes: $350

-	Personal Care & Hobbies: $800

-	Gifts: $500

-	Income Tax: $1000 (my tax is billed after year of assessment)

-	Emergency Fund / Contingency: $2000

	
***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: $500/mth, 6 mths [SO said I shouldn’t pay for accommodation, but I decided to budget for it anyway]

-	US Phone Line: $30/mth, 6 mths

-	Rent & Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths

-	Food: $200/mth

-	Transport: $60/mth

-	Entertainment: $50/mth



**Phase 3: Hitting the Tracks (pun intended)**

To keep track of my finances, I started an excel workbook with the following itemized and categorized spreadsheets:

-	expenditures 

-	income 

-	holdings


The data from these spreadsheets were summarized and consolidated into a overview page which provided a month by month breakdown of my expenditures, incomes, holdings, tracked my cumulative savings/debt for the year, and gave a rough sense of my overall net worth.



**The Result**
 
***Actual Income for 2016***: $35000 (and ~$4000+ expected in December)

***Actual Budget for 2016*** (extrapolated from 10+ mths actuals): $24,200

***Lumpy Expenses (Total for the year)***

-	Flights & Related Costs: $4500    *(+300 from budget)*

-	Healthcare: $900     *(+400 from budget)*

-	Clothes: $1300    *(+~1000 from budget)*

-	Personal Care & Hobbies: $1500    *(+700 from budget)*

-	Gifts: $1000    *(+500 from budget)*

-	Income Tax: $1200    *(+200 from budget)*

-	Contingency Money: $100


***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: ~$500/mth, 6 mths *(no change)*

-	US Phone Line: $35/mth, 6 mths *(slightly more than budget)*

-	Rent & Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths *(no change)*

-	Food: $175/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Transport: $55/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Entertainment: $40/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

I ended up keeping fairly close to budget, but splurged a little on some of my discretionary spend, particularly doing some travelling within the US, shopping for cold wear, work clothes, and high quality clothes/shoes for camping, and because I got into gardening. 

In our initial plan, my SO insisted that I should not pay for accommodation, but I had budgeted for it anyway. Along the way, some crazy shit happened but in short his mum became flat broke and homeless, moved into the half of his duplex that was meant for rental out. She stayed rent free and borrowed money. He didn’t want to burden me since I was technically unemployed, so I ended up squirreling money to him through a seemingly neverending stash of cash I had in the house. I also spent less on food, transport and entertainment than expected since we spent a lot of time cooking, cuddling and watching Netflix. 

On the income front, I ended up earning more than projected in part because I didn’t count on returning to work immediately after my break, and also from the following:

-	taking up illustration commissions (~$2,000)

-	interest and dividends (~$2,000)

-	nice relatives who were worried I might run out of money and stuffed me bunches of cash (~$1,000)

-	more bonus than I expected (~$2000)

-	selling stuff (~$200)



**Random things I learnt along the way**

-	Manually keying in expenditures definitely made me a lot more mindful of my spending, and think twice about splurging on things I don’t need. I highly recommend it!

-	Being prepared goes a long way. On my second leg back into the US, the border control officer held me back for a bit since I’d just spent 90 days in the US fairly recently (I buffered 2.5 weeks before returning). But when I whipped out my binder with documentation for every visa guideline (ESTA, flight tickets, travel insurance, employment letter back home, approval of leave dates, last performance appraisal, latest statements of all my savings, retirement and investment accounts, and pictures with my SO, etc.) he was like whoa, ok. I guess you did your homework, and he let me through pretty much immediately.

-	It’s 100% worth spending on items of good quality. During the trip, I got a pair of very good, very waterproof hiking boots ($70, on sale!), and it feels amazing waddling through streams without having to worry about my feet getting wet!

-	Plan using only your guaranteed income, and budget with contingency in the picture. Living the plan gets a lot less stressful when any additional income becomes a bonus, while unexpected emergency expenses are soaked up by your contingency budget.

-	Looking for work in the US is really hard! I tried testing the waters and sent out my resume, customized cover letters, etc. to maybe 50 companies. Most didn’t reply, some rejected me, and I got a grand total of two (informal) interviews from companies that weren’t actually keen to consider me at all (cause of visa), but thought my CV was interesting enough to meet me. Welp!

-	It feels pretty damn good to be on the airline priority list. It is an inexplicable joy exiting a long haul flight and seeing your luggage be one of the first out on the belt. If you fly often, don’t forget to sign up on a frequent fliers program and be sure to claim your miles. 

-	Sometimes life sucks and you just have to deal with it. ☹ Prior to my rejection at the US Embassy, I had tried calling them, and emailing them to clarify the visa eligibility and guidelines specific to my situation, but they gave unhelpful and non-committal replies that neither affirmed nor denied my eligibility, and stated that I should make an appointment with a visa officer who could better assess my request. Unfortunately the Embassy is not like a place where you can call in to demand that they process a refund / fee waiver.



**TL;DR**: I took six months off work to spend time with my long distance SO in the US. The goal was to be budget neutral this year. I made it through with net savings of $10,000, while picking up new hobbies (gardening), great experiences in the American outdoors, and some pretty cool learning points relating to budgeting, planning, employment, immigration and being prepared in general. 


*edited for formatting*

EDIT: 

Holy crap, i woke up this morning and my inbox was totally flooded. I've been responding to comments, but am back home from work and can do a proper update. 


1) Several of you asked if some of the things I did were legal. I clarified this in some of my responses. Basically, I did my best to research as much as possible, keep within the legal limits of what my visa type allowed me to do, and err on the side of caution when in doubt. For instance, taking on commissions only in my home country, keeping most job hunting activities outside of the US, and returning home with some buffer during the course of 6 months so I did not overstay. When in the US, I didn't work, but I did try a bit to fish around for possible future work opportunities. As I definitely did not wish to run afoul of immigration policy, I kept any job-related enquiries general, informal and exploratory, while caveating my emails / letters with my visa situation and how I was open to exiting and entering the country on a different visa if they would sponsor me on a valid employment visa. 

2) Some were curious as to how I eventually tracked my budgets and 'kept to plan'. There's a lot of very personal information in my 2016 sheet that I don't feel comfortable sharing, but here's a cleaned up version of the spreadsheet I made, with some placeholder info in each of the tabs to show how it works. The overview page is automatically populated by subsequent spreadsheets [Spreadsheet here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uuyj3JQrkj-wWdOz6VOzvE5sLGBHrcRrTN_RFU1LlHo)

3) A few mentioned that you are in a similar long distance relationship with someone in a different country, and would like to do something similar in future. I thought that you might find a cleaned up version of my projection spreadsheet, with placeholder information useful, though you may need some excel knowledge to customise it for your specific purpose. [projection template here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X6ThpIFXEfo-kB0iob_Xiq4U3K5NBl9Z7xwHdg-Pe1Q). 

4) Yes, I am still with my SO. We're back to being long distance, but are very happy with each other.

5) Feel free to ask more about the spreadsheets, or use / adapt them. Do be kind.These were not designed to be templates for general use, and are certainly not the most intuitive or user friendly sheets out there.","[200.0, 24000.0, 23450.0, 4200.0, 500.0, 350.0, 800.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 500.0, 30.0, 600.0, 200.0, 60.0, 50.0, 35000.0, 4000.0, 24200.0, 4500.0, 900.0, 1300.0, 1500.0, 1000.0, 1200.0, 100.0, 500.0, 35.0, 600.0, 175.0, 55.0, 40.0, 2000.0, 2000.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 200.0, 70.0, 10000.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ebbcn/i_took_6_months_off_work_and_survived/
t5_2qstm,Affirm and late payments,"Affirm and late payments I have been a customer with affirm for YEARS. I have never had a late payment and have multiple large purchases paid off on time, if not early. My check was delayed last month due to presidents day, and I had 3 payments due on the same day. I paid them 2 days later and have continued to make my other payments on time for the past month since it happened.

Now they are telling me that my $2500 purchasing power is completely gone, and when I call to talk to customer service, they tell me that they cannot give me any information on it and all I can do is wait for it to ""refresh"", even though I have been waiting for one month already.

When the app asks me to check my purchasing power, it acts as if it's loading up and then just goes back to the home page. When I try to make a purchase with affirm to test it, it tells me my purchase cannot be approved. I just don't understand how paying 3 days late ONCE in 5 years has them take the entire service from me?!

Is firm a good place to get a loan from? I’m 18 so will they deny me for no credit history? If i do go for the monthly can I put like 200ish bucks in to pay it off faster than 36 months?

t5_2qstm,Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC?,"Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC? Hey Everyone.

So recently I(22M) tried building a new pc and it didn’t turn out well at all. I fried some of the components when building it and had to return some of my components. 

As such, I’m in the market for a new gaming pc. However, I to make sure that I’m not putting myself in a hole financially. I currently make $1,750 a month and have been doing a decent job by following the 50/30/20 rule. My expenses are car insurance, gas, therapy, and car maintenance. 

But, as time has gone on as I wait for my $1000 refund from Amazon, I’m seeing some amazing deals go by that would bet me a gaming computer well around the price of just straight building it. And I’m wondering if I should apply for a BNPL Service such as affirm so I don’t miss out on some deals. 

Important things to note! 

I’m going to pursue my MSW this fall at Hunter College and unsure if these BNPL services will affect my chances for getting student loans. 

I also will not be making that much money during this time but I know I can pay the PC off by the end of august so I don’t pay that much interest. 

I also recently applied for a new credit card during the month of June. I did so because I knew I was going to meet the amount for the sign on bonus. 

Please let me know you’re feedback as I’m open to everything and would like to know what’s the best financial decision here.

Edit: To everyone the responded to my post, I really appreciate the feedback and wanted to update everyone on the decision I came to. So, I reached out to the affirm and asked them how much interest I would pay. So, assuming I did sign up, although I would be paying less interest if I paid within the first month, I would still be incurring interest each day. 

Example: 

$2100 Computer, interest is 15%. If I paid at the end of that month, I would have $2,415. Then interest I would’ve paid would be $315. However, they would distribute that payment over the course of the month. 

So, instead of paying one month after my purchase, and I paid 15 days after. I would be paying off my product along with $157.50 since they incur interest daily. 

TLDR; I’m going to save now and pay later. I’ll start looking for a computer once I have enough money saved up.","[1750.0, 1000.0, 2100.0, 2415.0, 315.0, 157.5]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/158x9zv/should_i_get_affirm_for_my_new_gaming_pc/
t5_2qstm,Affirm/ incorrect reporting resulting in chargeoff item was returned,"Affirm/ incorrect reporting resulting in chargeoff item was returned I was wondering if anyone had the same situation whereas affirm charged off an account on a product that was refunded in full and had auto pay sounds crazy right but it happened and I am still fighting it  on top of that I had an excellent credit score and this put me in a different credit rating category completely.   February 15th 2023 purchased an item from Amazon funded via affirm, by end March /April it was to be returned due to damage done to my home. Spoke with  Amazon who stated that they can take it back.... however, they could not fix the damage to the home,  so in order for that to be done, I would have to return to the manufacturer( which I did I have a case FedEx Tracking emails to prove all of that as well)

I then  informed Amazon AND Affirm (have chat screenshots on that ) figured it would have been handled appropriately .  Fast forward to October 2023, realizing I am still being Auto drafted for a product I no longer have($25.88)  for months and at $25 it's easy to overlook that coming out of your account. Then coming to find  that neither side did their due diligence to cancel it or make each other aware that this was returned.  I no longer had the product.   I spent countless hours  between work breaks  arguing my point, showing proof , emailing  screenshots ..until finally I demanded for arbitration and Amazon reached out to affirm and let them know they had the documentation to support( which was the same carbon copy I sent to affirm so they should have had it as well) .  I then called a firm spoke with multiple people made multiple chat messages all with the same response until I finally made my final phone call to them in November I believe it was on the 11th( I would have to look back at my notes) spoke with Christian who stated he apologized this wasn't handled he sees all the information he doesn't know why it was never forward it to the correct department for this to be handled and he assured that it was going to get handled he sent out an email and then on the 13th affirm answered me via email indicating they are processing it as a full refund and sending me $25.88 back for an overpayment that I must have made again this was always on auto pay until I believe October in which I had finally had it no one should pay for a product that they no longer had because representatives of the company did not do their due diligence and handle this way back in March when I no longer had the product this is an acceptable and I should not have had to continue to pay for it regardless of what a firm States on their website but I did unknowingly because of auto pay I should not be robbed for money on a product I no longer have because they fail to communicate with each other that shouldn't fall on the client
Then  12/9 an email was sent to me that for $25.88 it was being charged off. I did not receive the email until later in the month because I had no reason to look out for Affirm any longer as I had no other accounts with them everything was paid in full including this particular item that was returned so when I happen to see something that caught my eye with the word charge off in my thousands of emails I opened it found that the situation was never rectified in toto who was the last person I
 why would a company put me into charge off and collections for the same amount that they sent to me if I owed them money . I am currently fighting this with Better Business Bureau cfpb and I may need to take it to fcra because at this point the damage that was done to my credit caused adverse reaction it's very similar to somebody going to jail for something they didn't do wrong and then being released , your reputation is still tarnished in this case my credit report is still tarnished the algorithms that the credit bureaus utilize will never bring it back up to the high standing I had it and I suffered adverse effects because I needed to combine and utilize a particular loan to fix something that broke was in my home and I was denied and that is where I realized that they made a reporting even though I fought them and I told them and showed them there is no way that this should be a correct reporting.  
They are now even still fighting as accurate even without Merit .  I have to contact an attorney I did reach out to a person I know who is an attorney who has a colleague who deals with this who stated it's clearly evident but because they are not in my state I would have to find someone within my state. I also demanded arbitration and was never given the correct information to mail the letter to I was disconnected by the offshore reps indicating they couldn't hear me which also means they probably didn't have the answer or were told if that ever gets brought up to disconnect the call has anybody else dealt with this because this is ridiculous.  I HAVE overwhelming evidence that is in my favor and validates what I'm stating but yet they Overlook it my belief is somewhere along the line a ball was dropped and now no one is accepting accountability.  I am not asking for much any insight from other whoever went through this can you please help instruct me on what else I could do besides now having to take the extra time for arbitration and an attorney

Planning to use $10,300 check to help with the issue but not sure how to use it. My wife and I have racked up a ridiculous amount of credit card debt due to schooling, hardships, and indulgences. $27,000 to be exact. Thankfully, we no longer have to rely on credit cards, but now we’re dealing with the consequences of having used them. We pay a little over $1,000 a month toward these credit cards, and we can’t stand it.

Luckily, I have a $10,300 check coming in this month from the state—they’re buying a piece of my inherited land. (I can’t sell the land; it has been in my family for generations.) This will take a huge burden off our shoulders. But now I’m stuck with the question of how to use this check most efficiently to pay off our debt.

One option is to use the check as a down payment for a personal loan. However, my concern is whether lenders would deny the application since our credit cards are maxed out. My other idea is to pay off some of the credit card debt first and then apply for a personal loan. If that’s the better route, how should I disburse the check to improve our chances of getting approved?

Here’s our credit cards incase paying them directly would better suit us. If so, I’d like to know how to disburse the check among these cards.

Discover: $17500
PayPal: $4,000
Affirm: $2500

They(thief)  had already made the 3 previous transaction and the 4th one is when i got to know about the fraud. 

The next day, during my credit unions business hours, i informed them about the theft and they asked me to dispute the transactions and provisionally credited me the money. They said since the card was with me when these transactions happened, my card was most likely skimmed.

Friday, they(credit union) come back to me with a decision and deny my dispute stating that a valid card and pin were present. 

I called the police and i filed a report with them because i didn't know what else to do. I'm in CA so I'm guessing they won't even look into.my case as it is under $950.

I don't know what to do and I'm stressing out. $800 is a lot of money for me and I can't afford to lose it. What should i do reddit?


Update: Thank you for your help, each and everyone of you! This is the update


 I gave the Credit Union the police details, however they said:
""They(dispute dept) are adding that to the notes, however since the dispute has already been closed you will need to work with the police on the matter. I can provide you with the information the disputes department has given me via email, or I can show you the reason why the dispute was denied here in chat. Which would you prefer?""


The email they sent contained two images. One of a excel sheet image with the transaction info with just request and approvals and 5-chip reader in the POS card data input mode. And other image with no info but the amount and Loss Potential High. I don't know what to make sense of that.

Edit: To answer most of the questions:
-I normally say my husband “left us” when I’m asked by strangers, mainly because the truth still doesn’t seem real but he was in a car accident a few months back. He did not survive it. I’m only adding this because so many people asked about child support which is obviously not an option. Also, most of the debt was in both of our names we bought all of this together and with his income it was never bad, as in, I never felt like we were struggling for money. For years we used the JetBlue card to visit family, we bought this house about a year ago and we bought some furniture we needed, the payments were 0 interest and did not seem bad at the time with both our incomes. The only ones that are mine alone are target, Sephora and ulta. They were much higher and I had chipped away at them but when the accident happened I let everything slide. I don’t know how to manage everything on my own. So I thought stupidly I’d ask Reddit for help and advice. But, wow most of you guys are so mean without knowing any of the backstory or details, you just assume and spew hate.  I hope you never have to know the pain of losing your partner. 
-I’m still waiting on life insurance policy but I’m not sure how much that is going to be. It’s through his employer but he was only there for about 3 years so I don’t think it’ll be much.
-My mom had a stroke a year ago, she used to have a good job and at the moment she can barely move or talk. I can’t help at all with her care since I’m far away, my sister does everything and so I offered to take some of her debt since she’s not able to pay it at the moment. She only has those two cards and an Amex that she pays with her SS. I understand that right now in the situation I’ve found myself in I can’t afford to pay it but it’s the only thing I can do for my mom right now so I don’t know how to tell my sister I’m not going to pay it anymore. I’m sure she’ll understand but it makes me feel like I’m helping and before all of this it wasn’t a burden to pay for them. 
-A lot of you suggested I seek help for my “spending problem” I don’t know if I necessarily have a spending problem but I am seeing a licensed therapist and psychologist and am on medication for depression (obviously) and anxiety which help some.

My girlfriend bought a $1000 ski pass using Affirm (vendor that partners with companies to facilitate monthly payments, popular with ski passes in particular). A bug of Affirm’s made it so that she was unable to make payments for the first couple of months. She called repeatedly and they reassured her it wouldn’t impact her credit. They then filed a complaint with the credit bureau, and they’re saying there’s nothing they can do about it — even though they’ve taken fault for the bug and weren’t able to provide alternative payment methods. 

Credit score went from 780 —> 650. Is there anything she can do aside from organically building her credit back up?

Called Affirm the next morning as soon as they opened and let them know it was fraud. They did a quick 2 day “investigation” where I spoke to absolutely NOBODY in the fraud department and they emailed me today stating it appears to be mine. (It’s not, AT ALL)

Where do I go from here? I contacted all 3 credit bureau‘s the day all of this happened but was only able to get ahold of a person through Equifax. The agent tried to put a fraud alert on my credit but since I already have one on there, he told me he couldn’t. Last December my Social Security card was stolen, and I put a fraud alert on it at that time so that is still active right now. I called Affirm back today and spoke with a supervisor that took a very thorough statement from me regarding my SSN being stolen, etc, and he explained they’d look into it again, but it  didn’t sound promising. The amount is only $130 but it’s how it’s going to affect my credit that pisses me off. I have never applied for an Affirm loan, and I do not need a hard credit pull out there for something I did not authorize. God forbid this idiot open up anymore loans in my name! HELP. My credit is excellent and I have taken very wise care of it over the years.

EXTRA INFO: I moved TWICE in October as my partner and I were planning to move into a new home. I moved from my apartment into his apartment, and then three weeks later when the home was done being built we moved there- so I had to forward my mail two separate times in October.

I have a question regarding AFFIRM. So last december I bought 2 purses at Neiman Marcus using AFFIRM. The total amount of Loan was $4,XXX. First purse arrived on January (Amount was $2,XXX) didnt like the size and so i decided to return it a week later. 2nd purse was on backorder which I just received 2 days ago, and I would like to keep it. 

Neiman marcus sent me an email a week later that return was accepted and that they have issued refund (January 19, 2021) I was charged once by Affirm on January and though its okay since I have another purchase with them. Fast forward to February 23, 2021 my loan is still showing full amount, I called neiman marcus and they said they have issued full refund for the $2,XXX purse. They told me to call Affirm, and so I did-- affirm said neiman marcus hasnt issued  the refund yet & that they placed a hold on the $2,XXX purse. Called Neiman marcus again they said no they didnt place any hold & the refund has been issued and there's nothing more they could do on their end because they has issued full refund. Called affirm again and they said they need enough evidence showing that neiman marcus has issued the refund & that my remaining loan amount is only for the 2nd purse which is $1,XXX. Requested for that ""evidence"" from neiman marcus and the manager told me that they couldnt generate that kind of email since they already sent me an email on Janury 19, 2021 confirming  the return & the refund. Sent that email to Affirm but they said that email wont suffice as an evidence. 

I've been back and forth--- calling both companies multiple times a day and no one has helped me. Now i have a loan of $4,XXX and the $2,XXX purse has been returned but im still being charge for it.

Well it was a preorder and i wasn't supposed to get my items till late July. Fast forward mid August never received an update so i emailed the merchant and no reply. Almost September no products so send more emails and no reply. Same goes on through end of September.

Looked online for my options and it said I needed to contact the merchant for a refund and if if that didn't work contact my bank. Give them a few more weeks. I finally get tired of it and call my bank and they give me a charge back.

Well today I get an email stating my loan was sent to collections since i did a charge back. I call and they tell me my only solution is to pay it and unless the merchant gives me a refund I'm out $61. 

They said I would have had to file a dispute 60 days after the loan was approved to get a refund so even if I would have done it probably I would have been out $61.

I don't feel like i need to pay for something I never received and they aren't giving me any information to fix this and their only solution is for me to pay it or have the merchant refund it.

t5_2qstm,Chase bank lost my $25k wire transfer and has not got it back for 3 weeks,"Chase bank lost my $25k wire transfer and has not got it back for 3 weeks Hi Reddit, what I have experienced is so absurd that I have to post this.

On Jan. 23rd, I initiated a wire transfer of $25k to my wife from my Chase account to her BofA account. That day is a Saturday so we waited until the following Monday. On Jan. 25th Monday, the money was taken out of my Chase checking account, but it did not show up in my wife's account. We finally decided to call our banks on Jan. 30th Friday, after not receiving the wire transfer after 5 days.

We first called Chase bank, whose representatives (we called many times) claimed that the wire transfer had been completed and the money should be at the recipient bank. We then called BofA, who then claimed that they had never received any wire transfer, and that we should follow up with the sender bank. OK, so we went back to Chase telling them this story, who unsurprisingly insisted that the wire transfer had been completed. One of the Chase representatives brought up that I could start a recall request, but in the disclosure she read that the recall is not guaranteed. That sounds fishy? I asked: ""so you're saying there's a chance the money is just lost?"" and received affirmative answer. This person simply did not care where the $25k was and where it would end up. Anyhow, I started the recall request on the phone.

The next Monday we decided that we couldn't wait at home and headed to the banks' local branches. We first went to BofA, where a banker helped us do some research. What shocked me was that the banker needed to call the SAME phone number that we had been calling and had to wait for around half an hour before anyone picked up. Before the phone call, the banker assured us confidently that we would find our money, but after she hung up, we were back to square one: the wire department said that they had not seen any money coming in, or on the transit.

Some context here: the BofA banker told us a story that in the past sometimes the name gets messed up, so the money would be stuck on somewhere called the ""transit"", which is basically a middle ground for wiring transfers. Someone just needs to go and find it.

Ok, so the BofA banker, again, told us to follow up with Chase bank, since the sender bank would have more information and can ""trace the money in the terminal"".

We then went to the Chase bank.

I guess I should have been used to it by that time, but it was also shocking to see that the Chase banker, sitting in a glass door office, had to dial the phone for customer service number and waited on hold for 15 minutes to get anything done. Apparently they could not find the money either. Just when I was dreading about the matter, my Chase private client banker heard about this and came in. She told me that she had already started working on the recall request and that we would for sure get the money back. They showed me an internal email that showed the expectation should be around 3-5 business days. My CPC banker also suggested that I send an inquiry through their online banking ""secure message center"", which apparently goes into a different department and can possibly get me some answers.

The next day, Jan 31st Tuesday, my CPC banker called me and explained that the reason the wire transfer did not go through initially was that BofA had asked for additional details: my full legal name and my date of birth. Well that's weird, doesn't Chase have that information? Why would the money be stuck for a whole week? I was not able to get these questions answered.

Around the same day, the secure message center got back, with the following message:

>Thank you for contacting Retail Wire Servicing. We received your request dated 02/02/21 for wire transfer in the amount of 25000/USD dated 01/25.  We have acknowledged your request to know the reason why the wire was not credited to beneficiaries account there is a case follow up for this wire transaction/reference number.xxxxx  The update is as follows: • On 01/26 message received from BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.stating ""REQUIRE ADDL DETAILS PLEASE PROVIDE THE FULL AND COMPLETE LEGAL NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH FOR \[My name\].  
>  
>They were waiting for these details from you in order to credit the wire to beneficiaries account .

They were waiting for these details from ME?

The whole time I received zero communication from Chase bank, email, phone or text message saying that I need to provide ANY info for my wire transfer. Every status on Chase shows that the transaction has been completed, so did every Chase representative tell me. Now Chase is sending a message telling me that I should have done something? The absurdness is blowing my mind.

I replied pointing this out and asked for a written apology and monetary compensation for the time lost. No human response. Only another update that says

>We have acknowledged your request for a case follow up for this wire transaction/reference number.xxxxx  The status update is as follows: • No response yet from the other bank but we just sent a follow up regarding our recall request

I asked for updates twice this week, and received basically the same message like below:

>Regarding debit to your account xxxx for 25,000.00/USD dated 1/25/2021 your payment reference number PPL OF 21/01/25 our transaction reference number xxxx .We have been advised by ReceivingBank of the following message quote PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR CANCELLATION REQUEST. HOWEVER BEFORE WE CAN CANCEL AND RETURN THE PAYMENT WE WOULD NEED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. PLEASE PROVIDE THE FULL AND COMPLETE LEGAL NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH FOR xxxx. REGARDS, BANK OF AMERICA INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT xxxxx unquote.

The last one was received today. So BofA is asking for my name and DOB again and has not received any answer it seems like, and Chase is neither asking me for the info (nothing is needed from me from the message) nor replying to them. I replied to this message giving Chase my name and DOB (which is ridiculous) and I suppose I'll see what happens.

In the meantime, I have called my CPC banker multiple times, every time it sounds like she's sincere and has been working on it, but the lack of update is draining my patience.

Thanks to Reddit, I filed a cfpb complaint last week (around Feb 2) and have received a call on Feb 9th from someone from ""Chase executive office"" and got a verbal apology for the first time. The person on the phone claimed that they would start an investigation.

To this date (Feb 11 Thursday), my $25k is still not back in my account.

Pardon my writing. Immigrant here.

**TLDR: Chase lost my wire transfer of $25k, claimed transaction complete when I asked for it, and still has not got it back in my account.**

**Edit(2/12/2021**): CPC banker left me a voicemail this morning. Apparently the secure message capitalized above IS their way of asking my full legal name and date of birth. I'm still wrapping my head around how that's a question/request for me. Maybe I don't read English? Every time I read it, I interpret as a status update, saying ""BofA is saying **this** (asking for blah)"". The whole thing looks like a bot message and nowhere in the message are they asking **me** to reply to them with my info. I'm lucky I got used to the way they do things and guessed their intent yesterday and responded with the info. However, shouldn't they have my legal name and date of birth in the first place? How else do they verify my name and date of birth when I call?

Still mindblown right now. I filed an OCC complaint yesterday (I had already filed a CFPB complaint earlier).

No money back yet.

Since I filed two complaints from two different regulartory agencies (CFPB and OCC). There had been a moment when it crossed my mind ""this will cause them to make some duplicate effort"", but then I thought, why the \* do I care? I did not initiate any of this.

**Edit(2/12/2021 9:46AM PST)**: The money is back! A different Chase banker called me and on the phone call she noticed that the $25k has been credited on my account. I informed the banker of my ongoing complaints and she said that she would esclate the complaint. At this point I don't trust Chase's own complaint handling system and will follow through with my regulatory agencies complaints. I told the banker that their wiring is horrible and embarrassing. I also made sure she knew that the complaints were not targeted towards her but her company.

I want to say I won't stop until I get a formal apology, but in this world, you don't get what you want/deserve most of the times.","[25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lhrr49/chase_bank_lost_my_25k_wire_transfer_and_has_not/
t5_2qstm,Company went bankrupt and didn’t provide service. Filed a dispute with Affirm and Affirm sided with merchant. What are my options?,"Company went bankrupt and didn’t provide service. Filed a dispute with Affirm and Affirm sided with merchant. What are my options? Hello,

I’m looking for advise here because I honestly don’t know what to do about this situation or next steps as I’ve exhausted a lot of my options. 

Back in November, I signed my dog up for a 21 day board and training program. I went through this company who trained my other dog and I saw great results and decided to move forward with their board and train for my other more reactive dog. This included a transfer out lesson and a lesson at home plus equipment. I signed up for this via an Affirm loan of about $4k. I signed some contracts detailing their policies etc and of course their refund policy stating no refunds once training starts. No big deal, I knew I liked them and couldn’t see a reason why I wouldn’t continue service. 

The day I dropped off my dog I was given a run down of what would happen. I was to receive daily pictures and videos of progress, there were about 6-8 other trainers and my dog would receive training every hour during operating hours (about 12 hours a day). 

5 days after dropping my dog off, the company sent an email stating they have filed for bankruptcy. Great. In a separate email, they stated all training except the board and train would cease immediately. For the remaining, the trainings will be finished by only the owner. Additionally, we would not receive the 2nd at home transfer lesson. It also stated “if you feel uncomfortable about this at any time you may pick up your dog ahead of schedule”. 

I waited a few days to ponder my options and ultimately decided on picking him up due to:

1. No longer receiving any pictures or videos with updates. 
2. I highly doubt one guy was going to be able to provide the promised level of training as 8 trainers originally (because who knows how many dogs they still had in their board and train) 
3. A copious amount of bad Yelp reviews and social media posts from clients who claimed they signed up and provided money only for them to claim bankruptcy and keep the money + claims from people saying their dogs stopped being fed. 
4. I was not going to receive part of what I paid for (the transfer out lesson) nor further continued support which is also a benefit they state. 

I picked up my dog only 7 days into training. The owner would not come out to speak to me and the person I spoke to stated she didnt work there anymore but was a family friend helping out. She couldn’t provide any info about my dogs training nor a refund and simply stated bankruptcy lawyers would reach out. 

That same day I filed a dispute with Affirm and provided all information. 

2 months later, they close the dispute stating that the merchant provided the contract terms and that “services would have continued if I didn’t choose to pick up my dog” and told me I would need to work it out with the merchant, who obviously has disconnected their phone lines and make it impossible to contact any one about this. 

Afterwards, I tried filing a complaint with the CFPB and getting someone on the phone with Affirm. I spoke to someone who stated they would reopen the case and review further. 

The next day they closed the dispute yet again stating the same exact thing as before and then sent another message about my CFPB complaint stating that the late payments won’t affect my credit. 

So, that’s where I’m at. At this point I don’t know what my options are if I’m just SOL. Do I suck it up and pay it? Do I not pay it and just let it eat my credit? Do I lawyer up? Any advice appreciated. 

TL;DR

The finance amount was $1630. The total price with accrued interest is $2440.

When I saw the extra $800 in the beginning I called affirm and they said that would be the amount over the the course of the loan.

I started in March 2020 and it ends September 2022.

The minimum payment each month is $67 - she usually pays $100 a month. She has paid $850 so far but she still owes $1370.

It just seems like it never ends and the balance is staying The same. 

Any tips on what to do? Payment amounts that would actually make a difference?

I just got my tax return back and I’m wondering how best to prioritize my debt payoff. I have $6500 on a credit card that I currently pay $250 every 2 weeks on, the minimum monthly payment is about $180, I’m just aggressively paying on it. I also have $5668 on an Affirm purchase, but if I pay off now I will only pay $3500 and save the difference in interest. Both loans/debts have a very similar interest rate (terrible). My tax return can pay off one fully but I’m not sure which one to do. I really hate spending big chunks of money, but this feels right to do. 

If I pay off the Affirm account, then I will also pay off a student loan as well. But for some reason that affirm account isn’t on my credit report, so paying it off will not help my credit score (hovering just a hair below 700 currently). We are looking to buy a house in the not so distant future so that’s something I’m considering as well. 

If I pay off the credit card, then my credit score will jump about 60 points. 

The other option (the one I am leaning towards) is pay off the Affirm account, and then use the rest on my credit card and continue to pay aggressively on it. 

For reference, my tax return was $7500. I have $17k in savings currently as well. So yes I could technically pay off both, but would rather just pay aggressively on one and keep my savings.

As the title states I have been using Sezzle to help my credit utilization issue. To help rebuild my credit I opened a secured card that currently has a $600 limit. This is great and I only use it for my monthly recurring bills however since it was my only account I would get dinged for high usage constantly. 

To combat this I found a company called sezzle that is a buy now pay later type of service with no annual fee and no interest if you make your 4 payments. (25% up front when you purchase and 25% biweekly for a total of 4 payments.) I use this to purchase my ""fun items"" with respect for my week to week budget and typically the items are no more than $400. Now sezzle has me at a $2700 limit for the service and since I used my SSN to verify my identity they report the payments and balance to my credit. 

Is this a good idea? It keeps me around 14% to 30% percent utilization depending on if I am currently purchasing an item with them. My standard credit card balance alone with the sezzle account open and not being used at about that 14% range. 

I was extremely careful reading the credit agreement before signing up and as long as I don't miss those payments I don't get the insane interest.","[600.0, 400.0, 2700.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10gj8n4/using_sezzle_to_cheese_my_credit_usage/

t5_2qstm,I Was Charged $205 for a Best Buy Gift Card I Never Authorized—How Do I Fight This?,"I Was Charged $205 for a Best Buy Gift Card I Never Authorized—How Do I Fight This? Hi everyone,  
I need some help and perspective as I’ve been royally victimized by Sezzle, the pay-as-you-go app.

Yesterday, I discovered that somehow, in the background of using my phone, Sezzle had processed a $205 transaction for a digital Best Buy gift card. To be clear, I had absolutely no intention of making this purchase. I cannot stress this enough. I wasn’t even on a Best Buy website, and I did not agree to finance a gift card in four installments. Yet, I was charged $52 immediately for the first payment, with three more $50 installments scheduled over the next two months.

When I saw the charge hit my account, I was shocked and confused. My first instinct was to contact Sezzle to cancel the transaction. Unfortunately, the more I talked to them and the multiple other parties involved, the more hopeless it felt. Sezzle’s representatives weren’t helpful, and it became clear that they weren’t interested in reversing or canceling the installment agreement. Best Buy also refused to help, citing their non-refundable gift card policy.

I’m now stuck paying for a product I didn’t want, didn’t authorize, and can’t use. I feel like a complete victim of a system error or glitch that no one is willing to take responsibility for.

**What I’ve Tried So Far:**

* Contacted Sezzle’s customer service multiple times. They claim they can’t cancel or refund the transaction.
* Reached out to Best Buy, but they said digital gift cards are non-refundable.
* Begun disputing the charge with my bank, but the payments are installment-based, which complicates things.

It’s not just about the money that’s made this a bad experience. It’s the effort of every party involved to create the most ridiculous storm of a problem for me to experience. The fact I accidently became contractually obligated to a finance agreement on a digital Best Buy gift card. That concept alone is so dumbfounding that it eases the anguish. It feels wrong that companies like Sezzle and Best Buy can shrug off responsibility for mistakes (or worse, fraudulent activity) like this.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I really appreciate any help or perspective you can offer!

If someone here has experienced something similar or knows what else I can do. Any advice, insights, or suggestions would mean a lot.

* Has anyone successfully disputed a transaction like this with Sezzle or a similar service?
* Are there other consumer protection agencies or legal routes I can pursue?
* Is there any way to sell or trade the gift card to recoup some of the money?","[205.0, 205.0, 52.0, 50.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gzy2qt/i_was_charged_205_for_a_best_buy_gift_card_i/

What I am worried about is getting out of my house. I hate it here living with my parents, my mother is very demanding and is a heavy part of my mental health issues causes. I've learned a lot this year about investing, financing, loans, and other to have a pretty basic grip on it.

The plan is to take out a student loan for a years worth of rent in my area ( about 20,000 ) so housing is secure and all I have to worry about is making payments every month instead of rent so if I miss one I don't get kicked out, etc etc.

I think this is a good plan to build credit while securing a place to live off-campus. I have a history of borrowing money from online shopping services, specifically Sezzle, and have put over $1,000 on it on payment plans, only missing 2 payments ( of $10 each ) over the past year.

I make a decent income but just started working full-time and don't have a large stockpile of cash to buy the ring outright without depleting my savings and losing money I need to payoff student debts once payments return.

I can probably put a down payment of $1500 towards it but would hope to pay the rest off in 100-200 dollar monthly payments with a preference of zero interest installments or at least a low APR (8 to 10 percent).  

My credit score currently is around 800 so I should qualify for most loans but I don't know where I can find such a small principal loan with low APR.  Is it better to just buy the full thing out of pocket, look to a pay in 4 BNPL, or is there a recommended personal loan that can fit my budgeted rate?

Edit:
Thank you for your quick responses, I think I didn't specify the situation completely. 

The 3k price tag came from shopping around and found that the design we both liked landed around 3k as the retail price for it, if there is a cheaper seller online that can provide the same design I'm open to it, the price is not set in stone. Not sure if this is the right subreddit for ring shopping though. 

Additionally, 3k being ""in budget"" meant that we have the money but it would be taking charge of other expenses such as saving towards a home down payment, the weddings, the honeymoon, and paying off some currently frozen student loans.  It's not impossible to pay out of pocket, it would just shift around priority on payments.   

Lastly, the timeline is limited on this since we want our family to make it to the event and the longer it takes to save up the money the less chance some of them will still be here for it.",[1500.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15nhu1w/best_finance_option_for_3k_engagement_ring/

So recently I(22M) tried building a new pc and it didn’t turn out well at all. I fried some of the components when building it and had to return some of my components. 

As such, I’m in the market for a new gaming pc. However, I to make sure that I’m not putting myself in a hole financially. I currently make $1,750 a month and have been doing a decent job by following the 50/30/20 rule. My expenses are car insurance, gas, therapy, and car maintenance. 

But, as time has gone on as I wait for my $1000 refund from Amazon, I’m seeing some amazing deals go by that would bet me a gaming computer well around the price of just straight building it. And I’m wondering if I should apply for a BNPL Service such as affirm so I don’t miss out on some deals. 

Important things to note! 

I’m going to pursue my MSW this fall at Hunter College and unsure if these BNPL services will affect my chances for getting student loans. 

I also will not be making that much money during this time but I know I can pay the PC off by the end of august so I don’t pay that much interest. 

I also recently applied for a new credit card during the month of June. I did so because I knew I was going to meet the amount for the sign on bonus. 

Please let me know you’re feedback as I’m open to everything and would like to know what’s the best financial decision here.

Edit: To everyone the responded to my post, I really appreciate the feedback and wanted to update everyone on the decision I came to. So, I reached out to the affirm and asked them how much interest I would pay. So, assuming I did sign up, although I would be paying less interest if I paid within the first month, I would still be incurring interest each day. 

Example: 

$2100 Computer, interest is 15%. If I paid at the end of that month, I would have $2,415. Then interest I would’ve paid would be $315. However, they would distribute that payment over the course of the month. 

So, instead of paying one month after my purchase, and I paid 15 days after. I would be paying off my product along with $157.50 since they incur interest daily.

2021 saw a 20K vechicle loan at 2.8ish%, and 15K 401K loan at 3.15ish%. both at 60mnth repayment. Both of these were used as part of down payment on rental property. It was pure luck opportunity when height of buying frenzy in 2021, this condo unit took a 15% cut and still got it for under asking.

2022 saw a bad relationship breakup and spent nearly 20k on BNPL 0% purchases. This was split evenly between home improvement such as flooring and appliances, and lifestlye creep purchases such as stero equipment or tv projector.

After paying a lot of this debt down in 2023, i will see nearly $700ish a month freed up and looking for advice on what priority should be on how to allocate it. Here is where i currently stand at 38yrs old:

* 401K loan - 8K remaining 
   * i am contributing to 401k alongside the loan payments.
* Car loan - 11K
* BNPL - 5K
* Retirement - $300K
* Brokerage - $110K

not including mortgage info, as not relevant to this. i have zero interest in paying extra on mortgages.

I have 2 guiding principles in trying to figure out next steps: debt is cheap, equity is expensive and i would like to buy house in my city were average house cost is north of 500K. currently in a condo.

&#x200B;

So where should i put these extra funds? I understand benefit of paying off 401K first, but struggling to not see it as just debt. and if im paying off debt why not prioritize loan where im paying interest to bank? Alternatively my brokerage account won't go far in current housing market but understand benefit of retirement account.

I have tried Affirm, Klarna, Zip and Afterpay. All were duds since I have no borrowing history or credit score to speak of (I'm looking to build this as well). Another alternative is the amazon prime rewards visa card, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work or if it would be a good idea.

Super freaking out now that I want to plan my future, any help would be greatly appreciated! Hi PF,

I'm probably in one of the worst places a 31 year old can be, financially. Especially in the Bay Area. I've spent money willy nilly for almost 8 years straight. Now that I want to plan for my future, I'm **absolutely freaking out internally** (as I should be) because of how supremely I've fucked myself over. I've botched it as supremely as Da Vinci drew Mona Lisa. I have a sense of humor about these things, so I've got that going for me, which is nice. Unfortunately comedy isn't the trade I ply, so it won't feed me or pay my bills. This is my roundabout plea for help. What better Xmas gift for myself other than a nice big dose of financial responsibility?

Here is what I owe (not counting student loans, which is ~20K):

My income is ~5500 a month after taxes (and maxing out my 18K of retirement - which I only did at the beginning of this year when I turned 30).

I'm pretty much left with ~500 after setting aside $250 for food. What I would like is a game plan to get me out of this hole. Ideally something I can check on a daily basis to make sure I don't stray off my track. Maybe a burn down chart? How do I even budget?! I'm so lost and confused, and blaming myself heavily for doing this to myself. I can't talk to my friends about it because this is WAY too embarrassing (and I have this one friend who sometimes tells me he has a problem, which is having too much money and not knowing what to do with it - I told him to go enjoy life - which is the kindest way I can tell him to go fuck right off - and then I feel depressed and miserable that I'm in this situation). Which makes me feel immature for feeling that way, and that makes me more depressed. It's such a vicious cycle that I can't take it anymore. I started reading the book ""Your money or your life"" and a book title has never hit me harder.

I know need a side hustle and the only one I can think of is being a Doordash / Uber food delivery person (or take up a job on the weekends or both? I don't know where I can find weekend only gigs though). My car is a 2 seater Miata so I can't Lyft/Uber. 

[It feels like what I need is the help of a financial planner but I can't afford one, clearly. So that's why I'm here.](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201448/rs_500x220-140508105809-tumblr_mf6wvtEUVE1r6w7e0o1_500_large.gif)


.... it's 2:25am PST on Xmas Day. I'm so depressed financially it feels like my post is going to sink the bottom and never get any real / substantial help in planning for my future. If that's the case I hope a repost won't have horrible consequences :). Also I feel like nobody would want to be with me (I started seeing someone and I care for them a lot), which is why planning for my future is now the only thing I care about.

**EDIT**: ... it's 9:15am and I just woke up to shitloads of comments! I'm completely overwhelmed by the support and response, and it will take me some time to grok everything. The amount of support makes me feel like this is not an unsurmountable challenge, which is the best I can ask for at this point. Also /u/ironicosity - I was just sleeping (I posted this and went to bed at 2:30am or later), so I'm sorry I didn't partake in the discussion until now. I'll try to acknowledge comments individually now that I'm awake. Some quick updates though:

**RENT:** I live in the South Bay in a rent controlled area so moving isn't particularly the best option for me. I'd rather cut my expenses somewhere else, and I can probably get someone to move in with me by March after I donate / sell just about everything I don't need (a laptop, some books, and basic cookware is all I absolutely require).

**SUBSCRIPTIONS:** I have cancelled all of the subscriptions I can think of except what is noted above. I'm willing to cut out everything but AMC - my date and I are super avid movie buffs and I watch 3 movies a week on a consistent basis, and I don't buy anything from concessions. Outside of hanging out with people it's really the only thing I look forward to.

**CAR:** I think it would be absolutely stupid to get rid of it. If I were in SF I'd get rid of it in a heartbeat but where I live I find it impossible to get anything done without a car. I used to do it and everything took at least an hour longer. It takes me places that I need to get to and I'd rather use it to get some more money on the side, especially since it's almost paid off. I got it used for 10K with 30K miles on it so it'll serve me well for the next 5 years easy.

Obligatory thanks for the gold, stranger! Of all my years lurking, this is what gets me gold, haha. Thanks again, whoever you are!

t5_2qstm,"Bought a house in June 2022, now the city wants to buy up the houses in the neighborhood.","Bought a house in June 2022, now the city wants to buy up the houses in the neighborhood. To try and make a long story short, the wife and I bought a house in June 2022, moved in a month later, and now the city wants to buy up all the houses in our neighborhood to tear down and sell to developers in the near future.

Possibly relevant info: Mortgage info: $150,000 financed (no down payment) with a VA loan, bought points to lower our interest rate, ended up at 3.875%. With home and flood insurance and other taxes escrowed, we are looking at about $1030/month payments.

The limited info we have from the city so far is that they are expected to pay a fair price (Zillow estimate is $164K) and will cover closing costs and costs of moving. We may be able to go ahead and sell but still have upwards of a year (or slightly longer) before we have to move.

My biggest concern is if we go ahead and sell this close to initially purchasing we'll be hit with a big tax liability on the sale price being more than the mortgage, which we will really need to get relocated.

Other notes: We have been considering moving out of state. Our current home is really close to two big construction projects, the widening of the main road we live off of to a four lane, and a new outlet mall being constructed a mile away.

&#x200B;

What questions should I ask of both the city and my current lender, and what do you think our first steps should be in all of this?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: They have offered us $195K for the house. I'm concerned that between moving costs and the costs associated with finding a new home, we will end up paying more than that with the new interest rate even after buying additional percentage points and/or a down payment. They are offering to let us live in the house rent-free for a year, only paying utilities and carrying renters insurance on the home.","[150000.0, 1030.0, 164.0, 195.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/113w6nx/bought_a_house_in_june_2022_now_the_city_wants_to/

Now I need a new car I took Ramseys advice that a car should be paid for in cash. I agreed with this because I hate being in debt (my credit cards are paid in full every month, $0 in debt). 

At the beginning of this year, I paid for a car outright for $3500 off Craigslist. Even had a mechanic friend look it over to give me the go ahead. 

Not even A YEAR LATER, and I've spent THOUSANDS on repairs for this car. The worst part is the clutch started to slip along with major leaks. I've already spent around $2,000 on repairs. These next 2 repairs alone will cost more than I paid for the car. Every day I worry whether the car will turn on or not. 

My first car was paid for outright and this same thing happened. Less than a year later, the repairs cost more than the car.  

I could have used all this money as a down payment on a car that was actually reliable. I'm sick of cheap, high-mileage cars, but I hate being in debt. I don't know what to do.

t5_2qstm,"Considering buying a home, but my SO doesn't like the idea of paying towards a mortgage on a house she doesn't own. Advice?","Considering buying a home, but my SO doesn't like the idea of paying towards a mortgage on a house she doesn't own. Advice? I'm 23, soon to be 24. I've saved up roughly $25,000 in the past two years, and am considering buying a home. I've been in a relationship with my SO for over 5 years now, and we've now lived together just over 1 year of that. We've talked about the idea of buying a home casually (we rent right now).

She mentioned our ideas to her mother (a lawyer), who offered to write up a purchase agreement between the two of us, in regards to what happens to the property if one of us dies, we split up, or something else.

When my SO told me this, I was against the idea. I told her that if I purchased a house, I would want to purchase it in my name only. I care deeply about my SO, but we're not married, and while the idea of marriage has come up, we both don't feel comfortable getting married so young, regardless of how long we've been together.

She (understandably) was somewhat offended that I wouldn't want to purchase a home in both our names, and her feelings are that she ""wouldn't want to pay a mortgage towards a home she doesn't own."" Which of course makes sense! But I explained that if I were to buy a home, assuming she would want to live with me, as we do now, that I would charge her a very reasonable rent (no more than half the mortgage payment), along with splitting the bills, as we do now.

We would be able to move out of our small apartment, and into a private home, with a fenced yard, garage, etc. So in my eyes, she's getting a great deal, as we couldn't feasibly afford the cost of renting an equivalent home right now, and I would charge her no more than half of the mortgage (roughly $300-$400/month).

While I definitely sympathize with her, in that she doesn't want to pay towards a home she doesn't own, I can't help but feel a little frustrated. She couldn't purchase a home on her own to begin with, so for her, it's a free upgrade. She would be paying the same rent, but would get an awesome home and yard!

And just for fun, let's say I purchased a home, and she *didn't* want to live with me. I have plenty of friends who would jump on the chance to rent a room in a nice home for a few hundred dollars a month.

It comes down to the fact that I'm only (almost) 24 years old. While I am committed and happy in our relationship, marriage is a far-and-away concept. I don't mean to be pessimistic about our relationship, but I'm trying to make the best long-term decision for **me** right now. I *do not* want to have deal with divvying up the property if we were to break up.

I feel terrible, because I know she thinks I'm questioning the strength of our relationship, along with all the other thoughts that would come along with your SO not wanting to purchase a home with you... But I want to protect myself and my investment. And this isn't to say we won't get married later in life, because we just might! But for ***right now***, I don't think it's a good idea to purchase a home together.

So, should I forgo the idea of purchasing a home until I am committed enough that I would purchase it with my SO? Am I being an asshole for thinking this way? Did you purchase your first home with your SO, or alone? What advise do you have for me (us).

Thanks for your time and insight!

I have the money in the bank but am considering taking a personal loan to not take as big of a hit to my bank account. I’m also looking to buy a house in the next few years and would like to see it go towards a down payment. 

The new job would pay roughly the same as I make now but allow for more flexibility/benefits/work-life balance than what I get now.

Edit: current salary of 115k/yr, 90k in the bank, no debt, would need to stay until January for $14k of it to be forgiven, and then May of 2024 for the remaining $6k. The main benefits of the new job are that it a) would bring me into a different engineering industry which I actually want to work in, and b) its a hybrid role so I’d be able to work from home (which my current job doesn’t allow). My current company is poorly managed and every (and I mean EVERY) task that’s assigned is months behind with management pressure to work harder to fix it.

Edit 2: for those asking, my job isn’t *that* bad. It’s tolerable in that I could wait the few months for the debt to be forgiven, but I’m more concerned that the new position won’t be available then. I haven’t seen many positions in my area similar to it and I’d want to jump on it while there’s one out there.

t5_2qstm,My Experience with a Timeshare (Wyndham) Sales Team in Vegas,"My Experience with a Timeshare (Wyndham) Sales Team in Vegas I'm writing this because the Reddit threads on this topic are outdated and more people should know what I now know about the ""new"" timeshares. This is what it's like to be on the receiving end of a Wyndham timeshare sales pitch. Here goes:


I vaguely knew what I was getting in to. My girlfriend and I arrived at an MGM owned casino. We get a bite to eat and as soon as we began our exploration of the Casino someone approached us offering vouchers for free play in the casino worth $75. I'm usually hesitant to ever get sucked into something like this but my girlfriend insisted that we do it. ""They give it to you for showing up, we'll just say no, I've got friends who did this too, etc."" I went along and decided to keep an open mind about it.


We talk to this guy who convinces people to attend this ""seminar"" for two hours and you'll receive the vouchers, plus a hotel room for a few nights from a selection of locations, plus free breakfast. He insists that all you need to do is say ""no, not interested"" once the 2 hours are up and you can just leave with your vouchers. Obviously his incentive isn't to sell anything but fill the buses with as many people as possible.


The next day we get on the bus to the seminar location. My initial thought was that we'd all crowd into a room and watch some presentation before given the opportunity to bounce. I was caught off guard when every couple was assigned a salesperson. We meet our salesman and he immediately compliments us, is incredibly impressed by any of the words we string together, and has now become our fake best friend.


We go into the presentation and the speaker does his thing. And everyone here should be aware that much of what he said was true, but his conclusions were abhorrent. He pointed out that in America we do not use all of our vacation days. We tend to waste them. We are also constantly putting off that one trip to our dream destination to ""someday"", but ""someday"" never comes. Next, he points out that most people, dying people, regret working so much and wish they spent more time with their families. These are true facts. 


But then he concluded by suggesting we should all buy into this program which will allow us to take these dream vacations. It was the kind of sound financial advice you'd expect from someone who would directly benefit from the purchase and would never hear from you again.


I want to note, the speaker was talented and entertaining. He was loaded with jokes, self-deprecating humor. It was funny, but holy shit. Looking around the room were the salespeople with the obnoxious fake laughter. They saw this probably a hundred times. It was creepy. It was surreal. 1/3 of the audience was in on the sales pitch. 


The salespeople used every joke as an opportunity to measure the responses on the faces on their paired couple. The speaker would crack a joke and all the sales people would simultaneously throw their back out laughing before turning to the couple they were with to see if they were laughing too. 


There were no opportunities for me to speak with my girlfriend without the salesman eavesdropping. The presentation moved fast enough that looking anything up seemed like too much of a distraction. As skilled as they seemed at controlling my behavior, the whole thing was throwing up red flags.


Anyway, the presentation ended and our salesman led us to a table. On the way over there were other couples sitting out in the open with their assigned salesperson. They seemed excited about what they were hearing and excitedly signing papers. It was...weird.


We sit down and the salesman goes through the program in more detail. Here's where I get genuinely turned off. I work in IT, I'm about to finish my bachelor's degree, I don't think I'm a sucker but my love of science puts me at odds with a person who's giving me overwhelmingly biased information. He reiterates all of the great things about this program. He turns to my girlfriend, ""what do you think about that?"" ""It sounds great!"" Then he turns to me. ""And what do you think about that? Is it something you'd want to do?"" And I reply ""Depending on the cost, yes, I'd do it!""


Next, he has us estimate the cost of a hotel we normally pay for. Then he asks us how many vacation days we take per year. This is fine and easy math. If the average cost is $115 per night, and you take 10 days, it's $1,150 per year in hotel costs. The ""program"" (timeshare but they completely avoid the term) lasts 20 years. It's still vague at this part but the salesman insists on focusing on how much we are gonna pay for these hotel rooms over the next 20 years.


Cost per year multiplied by 20 years is 23,000. But that's ***not*** the equation they're doing. They're not accounting for interest! Ah! It would be more over that time! How much does it really cost? About $250,000. They estimate that the hospitality industry has an inflation rate of 11%!! Everyone should have it ingrained in their heads that inflation across the entire economy (in America) has been around 3% per year. 


He was willing to tinker with the numbers but, generally speaking, we're spending a fuck ton of money on just hotels according to their calculations. And any close observers would note that the number **should have been much lower**. $1,300×20 years×1.1^20 = $174,914.99. I could have been wrong in my calculation but their cost estimate was obscenely high.


Disclaimer: As several people pointed out, some of that math is off and I used the incorrect equation (this does not change the conclusions). Here is a better description from a more qualified redditor /u/mowscut:

>As an actuary, both yours and their calculators bothered me. No idea where 250k comes from, but your calculation assumes you’re paying the fully inflated price (in 20 years) for every payment. The full value is a simple future value of annuity certain formula which is P[(1+i)n -1]/i where i is the interest, n the number of payments and P the payment amount. This gives 1,300(1.120 -1)/.11~83,000. Which is also a crazy number, but formulaically appropriate.


Then he asks if we have any more questions. Uh, yeah, how much are we talking about here? They never mentioned up to this point how much it costs! But I'm skeptical and the questions I'm asking are things like how do you actually book a vacation? What happens if I change my mind about it? Is it transferrable? The salesman doesn't know the answers to these questions so a higher level salesman comes over. He's very happy to meet us. He loves the outfit I'm wearing. He compliments various other features and, with the limited amount of information I've provided, seems completely ready to compete with the other salesman for the title of my new best friend.


He answers some of my questions but can't provide any documentation to back up his claims. They still won't provide a price but they hand an iPad to my girlfriend to start filling out personal information. I look over and as soon as I see there's a field for the social security number I damn near slap it out of her hands. They were literally going to do a credit check to see how much the cost would be for us! Huge red flag for me. First, the inquiry shows up on your credit report. While that may not be so bad, I want to be informed on making a purchase and at least know a price range before taking that kind of step.


This throws the salesman off. Apparently, no one stops at this part of the process. The head sales guy says it's fine, and offers for us to check out a room which would be the type of room we'd be staying in if we join this program. *I still don't know how much this program costs*. We go and the salesman leaves my girlfriend and I alone to explore at our own pace. 


This is where I frantically looked for the Reddit thread where personal finance gurus say ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE, THEY KIDNAP REDDITORS LIKE YOU AND YOUR CLONE BECOMES A SALESMAN"". I found a few threads, and they did warn against this, but they were at least a year old and it didn't all seem timely.


I couldn't find costs online either, so I thought to myself ""how much per month would I be willing to pay for something like this?"" I concluded $45 per month. But I still had misgivings about making a big commitment on such short notice when I couldn't even read anything like a contract. I'd rather go home and read independent reviews so I can be confident in my decision. I couldn't get to that point.


Once again we end up back at the table but this time the salesman has a laminated piece of paper with prices on it! I immediately I see huge numbers and realize why they waited so long to show it. They wanted approximately $130,000 for the total program. It would be $13,000 down to get started, and almost $500 per month. 

(Note: when I did the math later, the actual cost we'd likely pay is around what they wanted for the program. But we'd be paying a fortune upfront and have a monthly payment. We could only go to where Wyndham had properties, which was in America or Australia or some islands, but if we wanted to go to Europe it would be through RCI, which cost about $300 per week. That's about the cost of an AirBnB in some locations, so if you're a smart traveller it may not be worth it at all.)


""Would you rather pay this?"" The head salesman circles the $174,000. ""Or this"", he circles the $130,000. Ooga not want pay big number when ooga pay small number instead. I didn't want it. $45 dollars was as high as I'd go.


This is the part where they tried to pit my girlfriend against me in an amateurish attempt at manipulation. First, they go through the list of everything we ever told them about what we liked about the program (before we ever heard a price). They even sneak in a ""you should be willing to sacrifice something for it"" and gave a few examples like eating out less or having fewer cups of coffee from Starbucks. So I'm telling the salesman that this is way too expensive and once again the head sales guy shows up. He says things like ""I thought you said you liked the program? You said it was a 10/10. Are you saying it's not a 10/10? You said you'd be willing to sacrifice for this!"" He was getting irritated. Then he turned to my girlfriend and says ""it doesn't sound like he's as rich as he says he is"". At this point I was infuriated. Best friends don't say things like this to each other. But I held my cool. I looked him dead in the eye and firmly said ""I'm gonna pass"". 


But damn, the manipulation didn't stop and they didn't give up. They leave us alone to fill out a brief survey with a guy who definitely doesn't sell anything. So this guy shows up, introduces himself, and asks us about why we didn't buy it. I was truthful, it was too expensive and I wasn't willing to spend all that for it. I also felt pressured to make a big commitment on something that hours earlier I knew nothing about. So then he offers to sell us a ""trial"" program. It's a fraction of the price and it only lasts two years. It starts to be appealing, but then it is also limited to certain locations. I ask to see the contract and the guy says ""what do you want me to do, sit here and read you a contract""? At that point he gets frustrated and offers to walk us to the exit. It had been 4 hours. We get our vouchers and leave.

Tl;dr: it would have been a bad financial decision.

t5_2qstm,"What I wish people told me before I got $16,000 in CC debt","What I wish people told me before I got $16,000 in CC debt Quick background. I got my first credit card by accident. I thought I was filling out a “loyalty card” at Cabelas. Ended up being a line of credit. I was 23. 

4 short years later and married with a baby girl, I find myself with $16,000 in credit card debt. I actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck. And when I say last dollar I truly mean it. We had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards. 

Less than two years later, we now have $16,000 in savings and no credit card debt. (We finance one of our cars) 

Credit card debt is crippling. My dad calls it the ULTIMATE SLAVEMASTER. It forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life. 

Here’s my list and I hope it helps you. I’m no guru, I just learned the hard way. 

1. You will not pay it off later. When ‘later’ comes, you’ll be buying other things to pay off later. 

2. Read Dave Ramsey’s money makeover. It’s got good tips and the tactics work. 

3. The Jones’ can suck it. They’re miserable and controlled by debt also. Don’t buy things you don’t need to compete with people you don’t care for anyways. 

4. Pick up a side hustle. I taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. My wife picked up Birth photography 

5. Talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. 

6. Be a bitch about your budget. Set it and don’t stray from it. 

7. Put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. Seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 CC debt. Not sure if it legit made a difference but I think it might’ve 

8. Become emotionless toward money. I would get so pissed that I was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. It was only till I stopped giving a f#&@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. 

9. Save nothing until it’s paid off. It doesn’t make sense to save money when you have CC debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. 

10. When in doubt... overpay. If you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the CC for 50 bucks. Keep basically nothing in your bank account because “you spend what you have.” My family could live off of $75 a week. But if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. So I would always put as much as made sense. A few times I overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. 

11. Unsave your cards on Amazon. So if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. 

These are just some of the silly things I picked up along the way that I think would’ve helped me stay out of the mess. We are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. I hope this helped!

t5_2qstm,Buying a house costs more than just a down payment.,"Buying a house costs more than just a down payment. EDIT: Wow, this got *way* more attention than I expected it to. To everyone who has congratulated us, sincerely, thank you. But there's been a good bit of negativity because, and I recognize this, the home we're buying is unique and has unique costs. We wanted an older home and we knew that there would be unexpected expenses going into this, which we prepared for. This is also part of why we went with a lower down payment; so that we had more money left over for required maintenance.

I think that [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/po7d9z/buying_a_house_costs_more_than_just_a_down_payment/hcvfylq/) really got to the heart of what I wanted to express so I wanted to feature it here:

> Looks like people are picking the story apart. They're missing the point. The cost of purchasing a house is a lot higher than just the down payment and there's a lot of unexpected things that can come up. It doesn't matter if your brother is a roofer or you have a friend who is a building inspector etc etc. There will always be things that your insurance, your hoa, or your survival require getting fixed.

For everyone who paid 1.2k down for their VA / FHA loan and has had absolutely no maintenance issues, there's someone who put 20% down to buy a newish home and had to eat $20k in unexpected repairs within the first 3 months. Basically...buying a house *can easily* cost more than just your down payment, and you should be prepared for it to, and be pleasantly surprised when it doesn't.

----


I'm sure most of this is known to many here, but my wife and I are about to close on our first house and I thought I would write up some of the process and costs here (mostly to solidify it in my head, tbh).

We offered 305K on an asking price of 299K on a home in a small rural village in Vermont.

Initial deposit / earnest money - $2000 (goes towards closing)

Upon our offer being accepted, we needed to put down a deposit to show we had ""skin in the game""; basically to keep us honest. It would have been refundable if we pulled out of the sale for a ""valid"" reason, which included things like failure to obtain funding / homeowner's insurance, or just finding the house wasn't to our liking after getting inspectors in. This deposit ultimately went towards closing costs.

Buyer’s Inspection - ~~$1200~~ $906

We bought an old house (built 1870) so there was no chance of us waiving the inspection / contingency period. We basically had two weeks to get a bunch of people in to look at the place and tell us all of the awful maintenance nightmares waiting for us in the home. Fortunately, ours was pretty good. They built them pretty solid back then.

The home’s water comes from a private well, and we wanted to test it for contaminants before we agreed. We also suspected lead paint on the home’s exterior so we wanted to make sure if there was lead, it wasn’t leaching into the water.

EDIT: So many people were yelling at me about the inspection I looked back and realized three things:

 - I had the initial amount wrong; I was charged $1106, not $1200.
 - The inspection also included the well water test (plus an inspection of the well / wellhouse and the attached 1200 sq ft barn), I listed it here separately
 - They based the inspection cost on google imagery which included a standing structure which was no longer there and charged me an extra $200 for that. When we got there and he realized they charged me for a structure which wasn't there, they refunded that.

So the actual cost here was

Inspection - $781  

Well Water Test - $125


Septic Inspection - $450

We had a dedicated septic inspector come over to take a look, because the septic is old (from the mid ‘80s) and in a weird spot, with a couple of large trees nearby. We wanted to make sure it was in working order and that it would be replaceable and that it wasn’t damaged by tree roots.

Lead Paint Test - $400

We also had a painter come by to check to see if the exterior paint is lead-based. We probably could have done this ourselves but he took multiple samples and I trust his results - seemed worth it for something which could be serious.

Total cost to this point - $4175

At this point, we’d spent over 2k on inspectors, and a LOT of time communicating with and coordinating their visits with the seller, plus agonizing a bit over the results of the inspections. Don’t count this out - it was several days worth of time overall where I struggled to focus on anything else. This is mostly money which would have been lost if at this point we decided to pull out. (if we weren’t able to afford / didn’t want to do the needed repairs which were brought to light by the inspections, then you could also consider this money spent as a small up front cost to keep our money later on.)

Anyway, we decided to go ahead with it because we love the house and have the time and money to spend working on it, and it seemed worth it because we plan to live there for at least 20 years. We are both 30.

Homeowner’s Insurance - $1400/yr (first year up front at closing)

The next item was homeowner’s insurance. I contacted an agent and got some *really* good quotes (~$700 /yr). Then they went to go see the place and went running. The home has an attached barn and the roof is a bit rusty; they wouldn’t insure it unless

 - We could get in a contractor to give us an assessment on it; whether it needs to be replaced or just some paint
 - The assessment suggested all it needed was paint
 - We could get the paint done before the winter

Right now roofing contractors in our area are SWAMPED. I called three different ones and none of them could even get to us to give us an assessment in time for closing. So, we backtracked a bit and contacted the agent currently insuring the home. She was able to help us, but the insurance costs twice as much as before ($1400) and they also stipulated that the barn roof be painted (just painted, though) and that the home’s exterior itself be painted in the first year of residence.

Homeowner’s came down to the wire; I started just after we got our initial disclosures and it wasn’t until just before labor day that I got this hammered out. Don’t put this off.

Barn Roof Paint - $4800

So, cue up the painters. I got three quotes and went with the middle one to repaint. Plus, he just seemed like a nice guy. I live in a rural area which doesn't have a lot of shysters so I’m apt to go with my gut on people.

Exterior paint - ~$10,000

I haven’t gotten any official quotes yet. I’m going to get one from the guy painting the barn roof and a couple more after that, but he gave me an “estimate” and he ballparked around 10k.

Closing costs: $13,683

Down Payment: $9,150 (yes yes, very low, I know.)

Cash to Close: $22,833


Closing costs include 1/yr payment of insurance premium up front, taxes, title lawyer, yadda yadda. Even with a very low down payment, we still owe more than double that up front to pay for closing, and that’s once again not including the inspections and the requirements from our homeowners. In total, our full cost to get to this point in the process is

Total Cost - $27,008

Total Cost including currently known required work - $41,808

There's some other work in our peripherals; the kitchen sink needs replacing, the bathroom floor needs replacing as well, and some other smaller things, which we estimate will add another 5-7k of cost. I suspect that in the long run, the sky's the limit in terms of cost. ;)

And this isn’t even including incidental things like:

 - Buying new / more furniture for a larger space (we desperately need a new bed - $1500 alone)
 - Buying a lawn mower / snow blower / snow rake / chainsaw / other tools
 - heating oil costs (~3-4k a year where we live)
 - paying for cleaners for our old apt (~$400)
 - Renting a uhaul for a couple of days (~$250)
 - Increased payment due to property tax re-assessment (rather high where we live)
 - And any number of things I haven’t even thought of yet.

Anyway, the whole point of this post is that many times in the past several years I’ve thought to myself, “hm, I have enough money for a down payment on a house! I should buy one!” and had I tried before we were in a more confident financial position, it definitely would have ended in tears and anxiety.

t5_2qstm,"Seriously, get and use a credit card","Seriously, get and use a credit card I've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. There are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. That's all. There are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. Here are a few:

**It's safer!** When you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. Should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. Yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.

Compare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. You have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. And if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. 

**It builds your credit.** When you use a credit card RESPONSIBLY, it will build your credit over time. Which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. Low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. Compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.

The caveat here is that you never miss a payment. EVER. A good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. You should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.

**Purchase protection.** A lot of major credit card companies (like American Express and Discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. This is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen TV or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. Some features are:

* Accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.
* Better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? The credit card company will cover the difference.
* Theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you
* Extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iPhone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. 

And many more.

**The credit card company will reward you for using it.** Most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. Same applies for paying bills. So by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.

Some tips on using a credit card: 

* NEVER miss a payment. EVER. You will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.
* Only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. This is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. Being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.
* Pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. When you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. Whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. Paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.

Hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. They're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.

Here's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. A couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. The purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. My bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. All I had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. Never had to deal with it again. Granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.

I applied for my first credit card the day I turned 18. I now have seven credit cards with over $100,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 819 at a young age. All it took was a little persistence and responsibility. If I can do it, believe me, so can you.

t5_2qstm,I'm 32 and broke. I finally made my first budget ever and I'm -$700 in the hole every month. What do I do?,"I'm 32 and broke. I finally made my first budget ever and I'm -$700 in the hole every month. What do I do? So, I've never had a lot of money, but I lost my full time job this past April and I'm now working part time at a bank while also attending college during the day, 3 days per week.  I make about $250 per week.  My grandma gives me $400 per month to help with my rent.  I know, I'm pathetic.

I've been having to borrow a lot of money from my parents, and it's been pretty shitty, so I broke down and finally added up all my expenses and income, and I make about $700 less than I need to just to break even.  I check on Indeed pretty much every day to see if I can get a second job, but the job market in my area is really bad, and I'm also kind of limited by my school schedule as to which hours I can work.  Dropping out is not an option - I'm a semester and a half away from my Bachelor's.

My rent is $600 and I am probably moving soon, in with my brother, which should cut that almost in half.  I did notice that I spend a lot of money on food - like $400 per month.  I don't eat out very often but I do cook a lot and I literally never check prices when I'm grocery shopping, I just get what I need for the recipe. So that's an area of opportunity.

But even if I cut both my rent and my grocery shopping in half, I'd still be in the hole.  I have about 4 credit cards all with low limits (the highest is $650) but they're all maxed out and I pay about $130 monthly for them, just minimum payments. My credit sucks.  I would get a debt consolidation loan for them (they all have high rates, like 24%) but I almost certainly will not be approved for any kind of loan based on my DTI and my credit score.

I'm overwhelmed by all of this.  I'd like to start digging myself out of this hole but I have no idea where to start.

I know I can easily afford it but rather than dropping all of $3k, I pay a monthly payment and leave what I would’ve spend in a HYSA. And once ive reached a comfortable number (not sure what that number is yet) then pay it outright.

I don’t plan on touching my HYSA for anything much really.

Purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  What I discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was ANXIETY followed by uncertainty.  In this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  I will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 The worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  This is called buyer’s remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  Why? Well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. I do not want this happen to you!  The following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ Emotional Manipulation

During my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  One is emotional manipulation.  The reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  “Ma’am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  Go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.”  Is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  You are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  That awesome new car smell isn’t helping either is it?  That feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  They are counting on you to feel this way. 

What happens next is quite primitive.  As our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. When this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  Have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  I had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. RIP Bootsy.  During these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  In this case fear dictated my dog’s behaviors.  Much like my old boy Bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  The budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**How to overcome trick #1 “Emotional Manipulation”**

Be mindful of your emotions.  Simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  I always recommend that we sleep on it.  My rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  This isn’t the same as picking up a Snickers while in the checkout line. This is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. Be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ Pushing you towards Payments

After the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  Car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  This has two benefits for them.  1) Making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  We end up paying more this way. (See Ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) The interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  The payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  Over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6K to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  See below how Customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  This is worth repeating...A $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**How to overcome #2 “Pushing you towards payments”**

Tell the salesman up front “I am not interested in going over payments right now, let’s stick to the price of the car out the door.”  You must be proactive here.  A skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of “well ma’am, I just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget”.  Just smile at your new adversary and politely say “While I appreciate your concern, I have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price”.  (Make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). They will get the picture.  You want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  You have now become a formidable opponent.  You have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (See Ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   Also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  Better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ The Finance Office

After a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  Here you meet the Finance Manager.  This person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  This is where even the toughest buyers lose.  Why? They lose because their guard is down.  When we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  Usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   You give out a big sigh of relief.  In my sales days, I will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. He knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  He clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (Nice job!). What happened next really opened my eyes.  He ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and GAP products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in Example 3)  All of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  Customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  Don’t let this happen to you.  Being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
I want you to know the background of the Finance Managers and how they get that job.  It’s not by going to business school and majoring in Finance.  They get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  That is part of the car sales business ladder.  It takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  You can’t put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. Therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  They are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

The first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  Let’s nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  He has one clear goal.  Convince us to buy what he has.  He doesn’t make as much money otherwise.  He will once again show us the NEW payments if we were to purchase products A, B, or C.  They make money in 2 ways.  The first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  They borrow your loan money from Bank A for 3% and charge you 4%.  The dealership gets a part of that and the Finance Manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  See Ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   The second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**How to overcome #3 “The Finance Office”**

As before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  It really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. I personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  Don’t let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  Be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  The convenience is worth it for some.  (See example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  Next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
Good luck!  I hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  I hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.   
 
 
**Example1**

 We are purchasing a $25,000 car.  Let’s say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
The salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. “Which one works better for you sir?”  Do you see what he did there?  He changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from HIS two options.  Many people lose here. They say they like one of the payments and lose OR they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  The salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (They always come back higher).  Great. Car is sold.  Let’s do the math though.  You wanted to be at $22,000.  By accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle AND you have no idea what the interest rate is.  The lesson here: Keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  When that is settled THEN work on payments. 
 
**Example 2**

A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ You will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ You will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
That is a difference of $720
Know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**Example 3**

Be familiar with the products BEFORE you go into the finance office.
 
GAP Insurance:  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-gap-insurance-is-it-right-for-you.aspx
Extended Warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
The $4500 example above was many years ago. Competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  Still, do your homework and check around. Credit Unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  Companies like State Farm Insurance now do auto financing and will give you GAP for FREE if you finance through them!  My credit union charges $349 for GAP. Dealerships charge $750 and above.  I hope you can appreciate the value.

**Introduction**

All,

Based on the rapid increase in popularity and price of bitcoin and other crypto currencies (particularly over the past year), I expect that lots of people have questions about how crypto currency will impact their taxes. This thread attempts to address several common issues. I'm posting similar versions of it here, in several major crypto subs, and eventually in the weekly ""tax help"" threads r/personalfinance runs.

I'd like to thank the /r/personalfinance mod team and the /r/tax community for their help with this thread and especially for reading earlier versions and offering several valuable suggestions/corrections.

**This thread is NOT an endorsement of crypto currency as an investing strategy**. There is a time and a place to debate the appropriateness of crypto as part of a diversified portfolio - but that time is not now and that place is not here. If you are interested in the general consensus of this sub on investing, I would urge you to consult [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_investing) while keeping in mind the [general flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) outlining basic steps to get your finances in order.

Finally, please note that this thread attempts to provide information about your tax obligations as defined by United States law (and interpreted by the IRS under the direction of the Treasury Department). I understand that a certain portion of the crypto community tends to view crypto as ""tax free"" due to the (actual and perceived) difficulty for the IRS to ""know"" about the transactions involved. I **will not** discuss unlawfully concealing crypto gains here nor will I suggest illegal tax avoidance activities.
___
**The Basics**

This section is best for people that don't understand much about taxes. It covers some very basic tax principles. It also assumes that all you did during the year was buy/sell a single crypto currency.

Fundamentally, the IRS treats crypto not as money, but as an asset (investment). While there are a few specific ""twists"" when it comes to crypto, when in doubt replace the word ""crypto"" with the word ""stock"" and you will get a pretty good idea how you should report and pay tax on crypto.

The first thing you should know is that the majority of this discussion applies to the taxes you are currently working on (2017 taxes). The tax bill that just passed applies to 2018 taxes (with a few very tiny exceptions), which most people will file in early 2019.
 
In general, you don't have to report or pay taxes on crypto currency holdings until you ""cash out"" all or part of your holdings. For now, I'm going to assume that you cash out by selling them for USD; however, other forms of cashing out will be covered later.

When you sell crypto, you report the difference between your basis (purchase price) and proceeds (sale price) on Schedule D. Your purchase price is commonly referred to as your basis; while the two terms don't mean exactly the same thing, they are pretty close to one another (in particular, there are ~~three~~ two ways to calculate your basis - ~~your average cost~~, a first-in, first-out method, and a ""specific identification"" method. See more about these [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Cost_basis_methods#Changing_methods) and [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/methods)). **EDIT** - you may not use average cost method with crypto - [see here](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#en_US_201612_publink1000256905). If you sell at a gain, this gain increases your tax liability; if you sell at a loss, this loss decreases your tax liability (in most cases). If you sell multiple times during the year, *you report each transaction separately* (bad news if you trade often) but get to lump all your gains/losses together when determining how the trades impact your income.

One important thing to remember is that there are two different types of gains/losses from investments - short term gains (if you held an asset for one year or less) and long term gains (over one year; i.e. one year and one day). Short term gains are taxed at your marginal income rate (basically, just like if you had earned that money at a job) while long term gains are taxed at lower rates.

For most people, long term capital gains are taxed at 15%. However, if you are in the 10% or 15% tax bracket, congrats - your gains (up to the maximum amount of ""unused space"" in your bracket) are tax free! If you are in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 15%. If you are in the 39.6% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 20%. Additionally, there is an ""extra"" 3.8% tax that applies to gains for those above $200,000/$250,000 (single/married). The exact computation of this tax is a little complicated, but if you are close to the $200,000 level, just know that it exists.

Finally, you should know that I'm assuming that you should treat your crypto gains/losses as investment gains/losses. I'm sure some people will try and argue that they are really ""day traders"" of crypto and trade as a full time job. While this is possible, the vast majority of people don't qualify for this status and you should really think several times before deciding you want to try that approach on the IRS.

**""Cashing Out"" - Trading Crypto for Goods/Services**

I realize that not everyone that ""cashes out"" of crypto does so by selling it for USD. In fact, I understand that some in the crypto community view the necessity of cashing out itself as [a type of myth](https://imgur.com/gE8hDnY). In this section, I discuss what happens if you trade your crypto for basically anything that isn't cash (minor sidenote - see next section for a special discussion on trading crypto for crypto; i.e. buying altcoins with crypto).

The IRS views trading crypto for something of value as a type of bartering that must be included in income. From the IRS's perspective, it doesn't matter if you sold crypto for cash and bought a car with that cash or if you just traded crypto directly for the car - in both cases, the IRS views you as having sold your crypto. This approach isn't unique to crypto - it works the same way if you trade stock for something.

This means that if you do trade your crypto for ""stuff"", you have to report every exchange as a sale of your crypto and calculate the gain/loss on that sale, just as if you had sold the crypto for cash.

Finally, there is one important exception to this rule. If you give your crypto away to charity (one recognized by the IRS; like a 501(c)(3) organization), the IRS doesn't make you report/pay any capital gains on the transaction. Additionally, you still get to deduct the value of your donation on the date it was made. Now, from a ""selfish"" point of view, you will always end up with more money if you sell the crypto, pay the tax, and keep the rest. But, if you are going to make a donation anyway, especially a large one, giving crypto where you have a big unrealized/untaxed gain is a very efficient way of doing so.
___
**""Alt Coins"" - Buying Crypto with Crypto**

The previous section discusses what happens when you trade crypto for stuff. However, one thing that surprises many people is that trading crypto for crypto is also a taxable event, just like trading crypto for a car. Whether you agree with this position or not, it makes a lot of sense once you realize that the IRS doesn't view crypto as money, but instead as an asset. So to the IRS, trading bitcoin for ripple isn't like trading dollars for euros, but it is instead like trading shares of Apple stock for shares of Tesla stock.

Practically, what this means is that if you trade one crypto for another crypto (say BTC for XRP just to illustrate the point), the IRS views you as doing the following:

* Selling for cash the amount of BTC you actually traded for XRP.
* Owing capital gains/losses on the BTC based on its selling price (the fair market value at the moment of the exchange) and your purchase price (basis).
* Buying a new investment (XRP) with a cost basis equal to the amount the BTC was worth when you exchanged them.

This means that if you ""time"" your trade wrong and the value of XRP goes down after you make the exchange, you still owe tax on your BTC gain even though you subsequently lost money. The one good piece of news in this is that when/if you sell your XRP (or change it back to BTC), you will get a capital loss for the value that XRP dropped.

There is one final point worth discussing in this section - the so called ""like kind exchange"" rules (aka section 1031 exchange). At a high level, these rules say that you can ""swap"" property with someone else without having to pay taxes on the exchange as long as you get property in return that is ""like kind"". Typically, these rules are used in real estate transactions. However, they can also apply to other types of transactions as well.

While the idea is simple (and makes it sound like crypto for crypto should qualify), the exact rules/details of this exception are very fact specific. Most experts (including myself, but certainly not calling myself an expert) believe that a crypto for crypto swap **is not** a like kind exchange. The recently passed tax bill also explicitly clarifies this issue - starting in 2018, only real estate qualifies for like kind exchange treatment. So, basically, the vast majority of evidence suggests that you can't use this ""loophole"" for 2017; however, there is a small minority view/some small amount of belief that this treatment would work for 2017 taxes and it is worth noting that I'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this approach.
___
**Dealing with ""Forks""**

Perhaps another unpleasant surprise for crypto holders is that ""forks"" to create a new crypto also very likely generate a taxable event. The IRS has long (since at least the 1960s) held that ""found"" money is a taxable event. This approach has been litigated in court and courts have consistently upheld this position; it even has its own cool nerdy tax name - the ""treasure trove"" doctrine.

Practically, what this means is that if you owned BTC and it ""forked"" to create BCH, then the fair market value of the BCH you received is considered a ""treasure trove"" that must be reported as income (ordinary income - no capital gain rates). This is true whether or not you sold your BCH; if you got BCH from a fork, that is a taxable event (note - I'll continue using BTC forking to BCH in this section as an example, but the logic applies to all forks).

While everything I've discussed up to this point is pretty clearly established tax law, forks are really where things get messy with taxes. Thus, the remainder of this section contains more speculation than elsewhere in this post - the truth is that while the idea is simple (fork = free money = taxable), the details are messy and other kinds of tax treatment might apply to forks.

One basic practical problem with forks is that the new currency doesn't necessarily start trading immediately. Thus, you may have received BCH before there was a clear price or market for it. Basically, you owe tax on the value of BCH when you received it, but it isn't completely clear what that value was. There are several ways you can handle this; I'll list them in order from most accurate to least accurate (but note that this is just my personal view and there is ongoing disagreement on this issue with little/no authoritative guidance).

* Use a futures market to determine the value of the BCH - if reliable sources published realistic estimates of what BCH will trade for in the future once trading begins, use this estimate as the value of your BCH. Pros/cons - futures markets are, in theory, pretty accurate. However, if they are volatile/subject to manipulation, they may provide an incorrect estimate of the true value of BCH. It would suck to use the first futures value published only to have that value plummet shortly thereafter, leaving you to pay ordinary income tax but only have an unrealized capital loss.

* Wait until an exchange starts trading BCH; use the actual (""spot"" price) as the value. Pros/cons - spot prices certainly reflect what you could have sold BCH for; however, it is possible that the true value of the coin was higher/lower when you received it as compared to when it started trading on the exchange. Thus this method seems less accurate to me than a futures based approach, but it is still certainly fairly reasonable.

* Assume that the value is $0. This is my least preferred option, but there is still a case to be made for it. If you receive something that you didn't want, can't access, can't sell, and might fail, does it have any value? I believe the answer is yes (maybe not value it perfectly, but value it somewhat accurately), but if you honestly think the answer is no, then the correct tax answer would be to report $0 in income from the fork. The IRS would be most likely to disagree with this approach, especially since it results in the least amount of income reported for the current year (and the most favorable rates going forward). Accordingly, if you go this route, make extra sure you understand what it entails.

Note, once you've decided what to report as taxable income, this amount also becomes your cost basis in the new crypto (BCH). Thus, when you ultimately sell your BCH (or trade it for something else as described above), you calculate your gain/loss based on what you included in taxable income from the fork.

Finally, there is one more approach to dealing with forks worth mentioning. A fork ""feels"" a lot like a dividend - because you held BTC, you get BCH. In a stock world, if I get a cash dividend because I own the stock, that money **is not** treated as a ""treasure trove"" and subject to ordinary income rates - in most cases, it is a qualified dividend and subject to capital gain rates; in some cases, some types of stock dividends are completely non taxable. [This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/08/04/how-to-report-bitcoin-cash-and-avoid-irs-trouble/2/#6af873a0a1d2) discusses this idea in slightly more detail and generally concludes that forks should not be treated as a dividend. Still, I would note that I'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this theory.

Ultimately, this post is supposed to be practical, so let me make sure to leave you with two key thoughts about the taxation of forks. First, I believe that the majority of evidence suggests that forks should be treated as a ""treasure trove"" and reported as ordinary income based on their value at creation and that this is certainly the ""safest"" option. Second, out of everything discussed in this post, I also believe that the correct taxation of forks is the murkiest and most ""up for debate"" area. If you are interested in a more detailed discussion of forks, see [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/7p1kw6/draft_discussion_of_crypto_currency_and_taxes_for/) for a previous version of this post discussing it at even more length and the comments for a discussion of this with the r/tax community.

**Mining Crypto**

Successfully mining crypto coins is a taxable event. Depending on the amount of effort you put into mining, it is either considered a hobby or a self-employment (business) activity. The IRS provides the following list of questions to help decide the correct classification:

* The manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity.
* The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors. 
* The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity. 
* Expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in value.
* The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities.
* The taxpayer’s history of income or losses with respect to the activity.
* The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned.

If this still sounds complicated, that's because the distinction is subject to some amount of interpretation. As a rule of thumb, randomly mining crypto on an old computer is probably a hobby; mining full time on a custom rig is probably a business.

In either event, you must include in income the fair market value of any coins you successfully mine. These are ordinary income and your basis in these coins is their fair market value on the date they were mined. If your mining is a hobby, they go on line 21 (other income) and any expenses directly associated with mining go on schedule A (miscellaneous subject to 2% of AGI limitation). If your mining is a business, income and expenses go on schedule C.

Both approaches have pros and cons - hobby income isn't subject to the 15.3% self-employment tax, only normal income tax, but you get fewer deductions against your income and the deductions you get are less valuable. Business income has more deductions available, but you have to pay payroll (self-employment) tax of about 15.3% in addition to normal income tax.

**What if I didn't keep good records? Do I really have to report every transaction?**

One nice thing about the IRS treating crypto as an asset is that we can look at how the IRS treats people that ""day trade"" stock and often don't keep great records/have lots of transactions. While you need to be as accurate as possible, it is ok to estimate a little bit if you don't have exact records (especially concerning your cost basis). You need to put in some effort (research historical prices, etc...) and be reasonable, but the IRS would much rather you do a little bit of reasonable estimation as opposed to just not reporting anything. Sure, they might decide to audit you/disagree with some specifics, but you earn yourself a lot of credit if you can show that you honestly did the best you reasonably could and are making efforts to improve going forward.

However, concerning reporting every transaction - yes, sorry, it is clear that you have to do this, even if you made hundreds or thousands of them. Stock traders have had to go through this for many decades, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that the IRS would accept anything less from the crypto community. If you have the records or have any reasonable way of obtaining records/estimating them, you must report every transaction.
___
**What if I don't trust you?**

Well, first let me say that I can't believe you made it all the way down here to this section. Thanks for giving me an honest hearing. I would strongly encourage you to go read other well-written, honest guides. I'll link to some I like (both more technical IRS type guides and more crypto community driven guides). While a certain portion of the crypto community seems to view one of the benefits of crypto as avoiding all government regulation (including taxes), I've been pleasantly surprised to find that many crypto forums contain well reasoned, accurate tax guides. While I may not agree with 100% of their conclusions, that likely reflects true uncertainty around tax law that is fundamentally complex rather than an attempt on either end to help individuals unlawfully avoid taxes.

It turns out we qualify for an affordable homeownership program in our area, so we figure we have 3 options: continue renting (hopefully at a similar rent), buy through the affordable program soon, or move nearer to family in a MCOL area in a few years and buy a home at market rate. 

Could you check my math and help me think of things we maybe haven't considered and if any of this is a good idea? Thanks!

t5_2qstm,ELI18: Personal finance tips for young adults (US),"ELI18: Personal finance tips for young adults (US) Are you just starting out your independent life, and looking for financial advice on how to adult?  Have we got a forum for you!  Here's a collection of pointers to topics of interest to many 18-year-olds;  the specifics pertain to the US in some cases.  These are  topics we get a lot of questions about in /r/personalfinance.  

If you don't see your favorite topic here (e.g. houses, retirement accounts, investments, etc), stay tuned for additional posts coming shortly, oriented towards 22-, 30-, and 40-year olds.  (Here's [ELI22](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/).)

- To start out, you can benefit from [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme) with planning and education advice for those in high school, and recent grads.

- The big change in your life at 18 [19 in Alabama/Nebraska] is you are now legally an adult for contractual purposes, so time to get [bank accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/financialinstitutions) in your own own name, i.e. not with your parents.  You want a savings account and a no-monthly-fee checking account.  Small banks and credit unions typically have [better customer service](http://www.consumerreports.org/banks-credit-unions/choose-the-best-bank-for-you/).  

- You're not going to get rich off interest, sorry!  But you can find better savings interest rates (1%!) at [online-only banks](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/nerdwallets-top-high-yield-online-savings-accounts/).  Put away savings as soon as you can, it's a good habit to get into, and starts your [emergency fund](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds).  We'll cover investments and retirement savings in future posts;  with limited or part-time income, savings are a better bet for now.

- You can apply for a [credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) once you have income.  This is different than the debit card your bank will provide with your account. This has pros and cons, but is a reasonable move for many people.  It's the best way to independently establish credit without paying interest. A [secured](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-secured-credit-cards/) or [student](http://www.creditcards.com/college-students.php) card is probably your best option.  Pay the balance in full every month!  If you can't do that, then you are not ready to use a credit card.

- If you need money to continue your education, learn about [student loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans).  This is a complicated topic with many options.  Be careful what you do here, since these loans [will be yours](http://blog.credit.com/2015/06/what-happens-if-i-ignore-my-student-loans-84434/) / your parents until they are paid off!  People who find themselves [in trouble](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/08/heaviest-college-debt-burdens-fall-on-3-types-of-students) later usually took  out bigger loans (~$100,000) vs. smaller loans (~$20,000).

- For cost-effective education, it's hard to beat [community colleges](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/four-reasons-to-choose-community-college-2013-11-15).  If you're not sure what to do about continuing your education, look into [two-year degrees](http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/associate), as well as taking credits that [transfer to four-year colleges](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/professors-guide/2009/09/16/10-tips-for-transferring-from-community-college).  

- You may find yourself working part-time or even full-time.  This is a good time to learn about your [rights and responsibilities](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/employee-rights)  as an employee, including [how you are paid](http://money.howstuffworks.com/wage2.htm) and [taxed](https://www.irs.com/articles/understanding-payroll-and-withholding-taxes), as well as what your employer can legally do with your hours and even when you can be let go.  Fortunately, taxes are low for most young people (if only because their income is low...), and you may even get a refund if you file taxes!  While your lifetime income is the single biggest determinant in your personal finance situation, at this age, your priority is not on current income as much as preparing for the future, thus the focus on education.  

-  This is also the time to start learning about [budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) if you have significant responsibilities; more on this in future posts. 

- If you want to save money, live with your parents as long as you can.  Seriously!   But there comes a time when you want to / have to leave, and you'll need to rent a place.  Landlords will want to see that [you have income](http://www.myfirstapartment.com/2015/06/how-much-rent-can-i-afford-on-my-income-two-simple-ways-to-estimate/), so try to keep payments below [30% of your takehome pay](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-much-rent-you-can-really-afford-renters-solutions-186462).  You may need a co-signer if you have minimal credit history.   You'll need first month's rent and a security deposit up front, and even utility deposits sometimes.  Read your lease before you sign it, and know your [rights and responsibilities](https://www.ziprealty.com/buy/renters-rights.jsp) as a tenant, and what organizations can help you if you encounter issues.  

- Roommates are a popular way to save money on rent.  Be aware of the issues that can come up with roommates though, since circumstances change, and you may be on the hook for their share.  Have all roommates on the lease.  You might even want a [roommate agreement](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter6-2.html).  Perhaps Sheldon Cooper has it right after all?  Alternatively, consider renting a room from someone who owns their own house.

- Aside from rent, cars are the biggest expenditure for many young people.  You can save a [lot of money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/) if you don't need to pay for one!   It's not just the purchase cost.  There's gas, repairs, and especially [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance), which is  [very expensive](http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/cheapest-minimum-liability-insurance.aspx) for young people, typically at least $100/month, and can even be $200/month in some places, or if you have a tickets / accidents. 

-  Your best bet if you do need a car is to save up $5000 or so for a [reliable used car](http://www.carsdirect.com/used-car-buying/best-5-reliable-used-car-models), then pay cash, so you can avoid finance charges and make your own insurance choices.  If you do need to finance a car, be very careful of financing offers for young people.  Double-digit interest rates are a Bad Thing.  You do not want to ""build credit"" that way! The loan and the car are different things.  You can't give back the car and be done with the loan, since you will typically be ""[underwater](http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/being-upside-down.html)"" and owe more than the car is worth.  

- Choose your spending wisely.  Money spent is unavailable for anything else. Make sure it was your highest priority use of that money.

That's all for now.  Stay tuned for the next installment, [ELI22](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/), about more on these topics, as well as retirement accounts, repaying student loans, health insurance, and other such fun things.

I have been served lots of ads on Facebook, and sometimes it is so tempting to just order something because of the ""huge"" discount, but then I remind myself that unless I really need something, my savings is 100% if I don't make that purchase. Also, be careful with those 0% financing deals. I saw that Tonal (smart home gym) priced their product at $2,750 for a normal purchase, but if you want 36 months financing at 0%, the price is $5,000+. So yeah, not really 0%. Even at the normal price, these ""buy now pay later"" purchases add up and can throw your budget out of whack. Please don't borrow money you don't have to buy things you don't REALLY need. Only buy fun things with money budgeted specifically for fun.

So far, I have spent $30 on clothing this year, and stopped being a shopping addict. I find that you just need to find something that resonates with you to stop clicking that ""Place Order"" button. For me, it's trying to reduce the amount of waste and plastic being thrown into the environment.

t5_2qstm,To pay off debt before or after buying a house,"To pay off debt before or after buying a house Hello! Me and my husband are looking to buy a house by June of this year. I’ll be getting about $150k from my mom selling my grandmas house as part of an inheritance to put towards a house. I currently have $16k in debt (mostly medical that went onto credit cards a few years ago) and the houses we’re looking at buying are around $160-180k. 

I’ve been having trouble getting my debt down as the interest rates are pretty high and the area we’re living in has a pretty high cost of living. The area we’ll be moving to is much lower. I planned to save $20k out of the inheritance to get rid of my debt as well as help with any moving costs/furniture or appliances we may need. 

Should I pay off the debt before or after we close on the house? Should I do a half payment before buying and pay off the rest later? My credit score is in the 660’s right now and the only thing affecting it negatively is my high usage of credit. I don’t plan on closing the cards once they’re paid off as one is my only regular credit card, and the other is a care credit which I use for our pets in emergencies.

t5_2qstm,June goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out!,"June goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out! Me: 31/F, fully employed, $3,145 net take home each month

I have been slowly working my way out of credit card debt for the past three years. With a little over one year of payments left to go on my $20K debt consolidation loan, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

With that, I have been closely monitoring where my money has been going this year. I am very good about tracking how my money is distributed (bills, rent, loan payments, etc) but have never been good about tracking what I have been spending my money on. In looking at my spending habits in January, February, March, April, and now May I have confirmed what I already knew in my head... I spend a shit ton of money eating out. In January, I spent $400 eating out on just breakfast (coffee) and lunches alone. In February, close to $500. Same goes for March and April. I was way down in May because I made a conscious effort to not eat out so that I could save up for a trip I took. It helped a lot.

I took a look at my calendar and found that I miraculously have ONE lunch appointment on the calendar and no breakfast appointments in June. This means I have an opportunity to save money by eating breakfast at home and packing my lunch every day. 

I know this seems so simple but I haven't always been good about this. My work culture is such that people eat out a lot, I meet with people over coffee or lunches frequently, and so on. Some of that I get reimbursed but a lot of it is just eating out with coworkers. I live in a mid-sized city, so lunches cost anywhere from $10-18/lunch. Not terrible, but like many of you know, that adds up!

I'm excited to challenge myself this month and hopefully save a butt load of money. This money could be better spent either in savings account (that's dismal right now) or paying off loans. 

Thanks for reading. I really feel like I am starting to make a turn in how I manage money and am so looking forward to financial freedom in the very near future. My June goal to not eat breakfast or lunches out will help give me the boost I need and hopefully, become a habit of mine.

**EDIT (6/1, 8:40AM EST):** 
Wow! I wasn't quite expecting that type of response! A couple of things I learned from you.

* Scaling back or cutting the number of meals you eat out can make a big difference financially.  
* It can also make a difference health-wise!  
* It's important to be strategic about when you eat out, especially when it comes to work and colleagues. Even though you aren't going out and buying lunch, don't exclude yourself from group situations if possible.  
* When meal planning, variety is key. Some of you mentioned getting bored with the meals you were making at home and as a result, would slip up and buy food.  
* r/mealprepsunday was mentioned several times as a resource for planning.  
* Really examine why you're in debt to begin with. And once you pay off that debt, consider investing the money you no longer are using to pay down debt. Your future self with thank you!  
* More than anything, it's about having realistic goals and making sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure. 

I very much enjoyed reading all of your responses, tips, and well-wishes! It has given me great motivation for today - Day 1! For breakfast I had Cheerios at home. I packed myself a lunch and headed to work where I am now sipping a free hazelnut coffee. 

I look forward to catching up with you all at the end of the month. For my own purposes, I will be keeping a daily log of what I spend (including non-food related items), what I meal prep and eat, and what noticeable changes I see. I've never had a ""blog"" so to speak, but I might consider starting one so I can share all of this with you later this month. Any suggestions you have for sites would be most helpful!

CHEERS!

Was expecting a more unified response that maybe I was just overlooking in my situation. Nonetheless, thank you for all the thoughtful responses and friendly support!**


32 years old in MCOL area with solid IT job of 7 years. 

Salary: $80K

Net monthly income: $3600

Leftover after rent and bills: $1000

Roth IRA, HSA, employer 401K match all maxed

$15K in savings. Assume my mortgage would be the same as what I’m paying currently to rent. 

Have a leased Lexus and I’m handing back the keys in June when the lease ends (which will free up $600 in extra cash flow per month). I’m also living in an apartment and the lease ends in July. 

Scenario 1) I can go out and buy a $10K Toyota in cash and have $5K as a small emergency fund while I build it back up using the extra cash flow. Sign apt lease for another year while I build up my savings again to put down on a house/duplex later. 

Scenario 2) I can take that $10/15K  and put it down on a duplex now and house hack. Build equity and have a home secured for the future. Eventually buy another home and rent out the 2nd part of the duplex I was formerly living in for cash flow and extra equity. 

———————————————

Thoughts on each scenario:

Scenario 1 - I’ll have a paid off reliable car for years to come and increased cash flow to build the e-fund up faster. But the downside is that I continue to rent. 

Scenario 2 - an FHA loan allows me to put $10K down to secure a home (another $5k in savings for maintenance), build equity and create extra cash flow in the process. Downside is I wouldn’t have much for a down payment on a car so I’ll be paying a higher monthly payment and have a car that is not close to being paid off.

We did it guys! My fiancé and I managed to back out of this terrible loan, 5 days after signing. Here’s the full story of how this loan was unwinded if you’re interested:

The day after signing, we went in and told them we’d like to cancel. We expressed our regrets with signing without giving it enough thought. I even told them how debilitating my anxiety can be, which contributed to me succumbing to the high pressure they give customers. They denied the high pressure and said that there was no reason for me to be anxious. I fought that point a little but but ultimately told them it was a mistake and that we’d be so grateful if they could void the contract. The sales manager seemed disappointed but okay to see if he can make that happen for us. He left to talk to his GM and came back 5 min later, saying that he would cancel but cannot because the loan has “gone through” with the bank. Apparently, there was nothing the dealership could do. Bewildered, we gave the bank a call to see if it actually works that way. After a 2-hour hold, we got to a CSR who told us that nothing would have gone through in less than 24 hours and that it is 100% not up to the bank to keep this loan in place. 

We went back to the sales manager and told him this. There was a lot of back and forth (obviously they were lying to us) and the GM came into the picture. The GM was very contradictory, going from saying “we made it clear to you that there’s nothing in my power that can void this contract” to “legally I don’t have to do anything for you.” He also reminded us that he now owns the car that we traded in. He pointed out how great of a car we signed up for, highest trim, sunroof, etc. When we told him that it’s not about the car but about the loan, he tried to convince us that we were doing the math wrong and aren’t looking at the bigger picture (less interest payments). We expressed that we really don’t want it. He gave us a deal: pay him $5k to get your old car back and cancel this loan, or keep the contract but receive incentives such as $2000 rebate, free oil changes for life, etc. We told him we’d think it over and come back tomorrow. We did not take delivery of the new car.

The next day (Saturday), my fiancé went in alone cause I had work. Taking the advice from fellow redditors, we decided to go into offense mode. I had drafted a letter explaining our experience with them to be mailed to various consumer affairs agencies in our region. He went in with that letter. In the middle of the showroom, my fiancé told the GM that we are willing to take the $5k deal to get our car back (this was a bluff, just wanted to see where it would take us). He asked the GM if we could have this deal written on paper so that we can have it looked over by our lawyer and ensure that we will get our car back from this (we never actually had a lawyer). Taken aback, the GM said that he feels bad taking our money like that and went on to encourage us to keep the new car. By this point, my fiancé was getting pissed and raised his voice. He told the GM that in no way is this car deal good for us and that he’d like him to stop trying to shove it down our throats. He told him that a lower interest rate doesn’t mean shit if we’re getting ripped off $20k. He pulled out the letter, told him that we’ll be contacting these agencies and that we will be going forward with a lawyer. He also mentioned that all conversations since the day before have been recorded. The GM chuckled and told him to do whatever he wants (all this was happening in the showroom with many employees watching in silence). The GM kept saying “let me figure something out for you, don’t stress, man” and my fiancé stormed out. Outside the dealership, in plain view of the people inside, he took multiple photos of the new car and of a misleading ad sign they had for “one year of car insurance on us.” The GM ran out to him and said “I didn’t want to say this in front of them but I do want to cancel this for you. Just give me till Monday cause the banks are closed tomorrow. I gotta make some calls and pull some strings. Trust me, I’ll do what I can. Don’t stress”

Fast foward to Tuesday morning. We went into the dealership expecting the GM to make up another reason to keep us locked in. To our pleasant surprise, we were welcomed by their finance director who took us into her office and offered us two options: keep the car contract but with biweekly payments reduced to $371 CAD biweekly (from $389) with a slightly lower interest rate, or cancel the contract but pay $1200 CAD for the new car restocking fee and servicing that had already been done on our old car. We paid them the $1200 and drove off in our old car, taking that as the price to pay for our bad decision. 

It was important for me to write all this out for anyone in the future who finds themselves in this situation. There is hope and if you stand your ground, you have a chance to get out of a bad car deal. I think it helped that we initially acknowledged our responsibility in this instead of putting all the blame on them. This was a big life lesson for us and I’m kind of glad to have gotten that lesson early in life (we are in our early twenties). My parents saw nothing wrong with this car deal. That was a big eye opener for me. Many older adults just aren’t smart with money and I don’t want to be like that. We will soon be looking into refinancing our current car, pay it down and not even think about getting rid of it before we break even!","[69.0, 5.0, 2000.0, 5.0, 20.0, 371.0, 389.0, 1200.0, 1200.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ftpa8s/update_on_that_69k_cad_car_loan_i_signed_up_for/
t5_2qstm,The three month rule,"The three month rule Years ago, as I was first starting on my journey to financial stability, I had a problem with impulsive buying. Not expensive things, but they would add up. So I came up with a rule for myself: I need to **want it** for more than three months before I would buy it.

This worked well, and I have since changed my behavior so much that I don't even need to follow the rule anymore. I can instantly sense when it's an impulsive buy, and when it's something I really believe would improve my life satisfaction.

So, after reading this sub for a while now, I'm curious if you have some similar rules of thumb for yourself. Not necessarily for impulsive buys, but perhaps for other venues of personal finance management. Something we could all learn from?
If so, please share.

---

EDIT: wow, so many different responses, I can't keep track anymore. thank you for all your feedback. So far I've gotten a lot of good comments.

In a nutshell, these are the best ideas I could find in the feed:

- for every 100 dollars spent do that amount of hours to do the research (100 dollars = 1 hour)

- walk around the store with the item before you buy it, called ""walking the item"" - this was the funniest one

- use wishlists to defer decision to a later time

- spending in terms of days of retirement (would i rather buy $100 item or retire two days early?)

- thinking in terms of hours worked (I need to work for x amount of hours to buy this. is it worth it?)

- a variation on the above one, where you first deduct your living expenses, what remains you calculate into hourly wage that you *really* have at your disposal and only then consider how many hours you need to work for it

- buying only after running x number of miles (works both for impulse buys and getting yourself in shape)

- the old 'if you can't afford two of those, you can't afford one' was very common and very popular ([a variation on this with a 3x approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djq4357/))

- a lot of jokes how you can't do this with food (teasing me about the three month thing)

- and other that said they do that for food as well (obviously not in terms of not eating, but rather in terms of eating certain junk foods they like)

- buy memories, not things

- practicing artificial scarcity. This one is a bit trickier to explain so [I'll let the original comment speak for itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djpaw4u/)

- think about the dollar per use ratio. So if it's something you won't use often, how expensive is it? Is it worth it?

- take a picture of the item you want while shopping. at home look at the pictures and do the research. usually you realize you didn't really want it by then

I hoped I would get more that weren't for impulse buys, like I stated above... Other personal finance life hacks, but I'm sure these rules of thumb can be used by others.

Also, my mailbox is full, sorry I can't respond to all of you. I really tried :)

t5_2qstm,2 years later UPDATE: Need to buy a house within 6 months (Pregnant). Trying to quickly improve credit score.,"2 years later UPDATE: Need to buy a house within 6 months (Pregnant). Trying to quickly improve credit score. [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vtetl/need_to_buy_a_house_within_6_months_pregnant/)

I always love updates, so I figured I would share mine. 

So, after I was torn apart in my original thread, my boyfriend and I sat down and discussed feasibility. We decided to put buying a house on hold for awhile. We didn't wait as long as we had originally determined because we got back our interest rate and it wasn't as bad as some people had predicted. Additionally, my dad pointed out that we could always refinance.  I ran the numbers 15 different ways and looked at our budget from all angles and decided that while it financially may be better to wait, we could afford it if it was our priority. After sorting everything out, we started shopping, and we bought a house in July when I was 5 months pregnant.

**So, here are our current stats:**

House Cost: 275k with 5k in closing costs credit

Original Interest Rate: 4.75%

Refinanced September 2015 Interest Rate: 4.025%

PMI: $150

Down Payment: 25k (Just under 10%)

Current Equity: 16%

Current Credit Scores:

* Me- 780
* Him- 670

Income: 

* Me- 63k plus ~10% bonus (as of December 2015. Prior to that, I had one raise in May 2014 so 45k to 50k)
* Him- ~90k (contingent on work-- he's a welder)

Savings: 15k 

Retirement: I'll be honest-- I'm not sure about this one because his pension complicates things. Mine has 28k and I plan start putting into a Roth IRA this year. His has much much more between his 401k and pension. 

A note on the credit scores-- they pretty much immediately recovered when we started to pay a mortgage. My husband's is low still because when we transferred him to my cell phone family plan right around when we bought the house, there was a residual bill that he was not notified of (it went to our old apartment), and it went to collections. That was a very nasty surprise when we went to refinance, and cost us our 3.75% interest rate that we thought we were going to get. I now am our CFO and manage all the bills, so we shouldn't have anything slipping through the cracks anytime soon. His score should make a full recovery soon enough. 

**Key Takeaways:**

I think if I could do it all again, I would still buy our house. We got a great deal and honestly I haven't seen a house cheaper than 300k in our area since we bought it, outside of ones that needed to be gutted. We are 6 blocks from my parents, have a huge yard, and my walk to the train is 7 minutes. In the span of just over a year, we bought a house, had a baby, and got married. I'm excited to have some of the most expensive things in my life finished, and we are saving a ton of money each month now. 

Personal finance has been a great help to me over the years but I will say that in that scenario, knowing what I know now, I didn't think that the answers were necessarily helpful nor entirely accurate. I'd say people got caught up in their opinions of my stress and relationship rather than the financial aspects. The decision to buy a house was easily feasible with our finances, but not necessarily a perfect financial decision. I'd happily pay the price all over again to end up in this house. 

What would have been more helpful towards making a decision: 

* understanding that PMI increases with lower down payment and credit scores
* info on closing costs (I had NO idea how much they were)
* info on how long it takes for credit scores to recover-- if I knew that I could make improvements in a year, I may have been more likely to wait

Overall, I'm thankful that people pushed me to think the decision through more and to really do an in depth financial analysis. Ironically, that analysis led me to increase our budget, because I realized that we were way below 30% of our gross with our initial budget. We didn't like the first batch of houses we saw, and increasing our budget allowed us to see houses that were exactly what we wanted and that we'd actually be willing to stay in for long term. 

**Current Questions**

* College fund-- it seems like the 529b is the right way to go. Are there any major downsides that I'm missing?
* Grocery bills-- we are averaging 1k per month. We eat organic and buy fancy coffee, but that's it. Anyone have tips for planning meals/shopping successfully without any extreme couponing/going to 5 stores would be appreciated. For instance-- buying meat on sale and vacuum sealing for deep freezing-- is that financially efficient?
* For equivalent cash value, are points better on CCs, or miles? I would make use of either, so I'm just trying to get the best bang for my buck. 
* Also for CCs-- are their any cards that reward more or are better for someone who spends say 30k-50k per year? We put *everything* on CC (and pay it off each month) so I'm just trying to make sure that is optimized. 
* For taxes-- our income last year put us in the bracket where we no longer got the child tax credit. I would have to put 9k into my traditional IRA to be eligible again-- is that worth it? The credit is 4k...


Thanks PF... I read posts pretty much daily and I've learned a lot. Again, I don't think that purchasing my house was a financially smart decision, but it was easily feasible and it made sense for our priorities. We will soon have our PMI gone (paying extra each month) and at that point I'll be satisfied with our mortgage.

t5_2qstm,"After 18 months, my wife and I paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. Time to save for a house!","After 18 months, my wife and I paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. Time to save for a house! I don't really have any particularly interesting methods to share, just the tried and true stuff you've seen on here a million times. I will share none the less, because it never hurts to hear good advice more than once! Also, I think getting everyone's unique perspective on the situation can be interesting. And who doesn't like a feel good story? Right?

So to start with, some background about us. I'm 30, she's 27, and we've been together for over 12 years, married for 3. We started dating in High School! So I guess based on that fun fact alone we're already beating the odds. All of the student loans were hers. When I went to college I was in a bad place in my life, struggling with depression, living with an alcoholic father after an insanely long and bitter divorce of my parents, and generally feeling unmotivated to do anything. So... I didn't, and my grades in college were proof of that. I was put on academic probation after my first semester. My grades didn't improve in my second semester, and I was asked to take a semester off. I just never went back. This was probably the lowest point of my life. 

Luckily for me, the only thing I was ever truly passionate about was computers, and I had taken up programming as a hobby in my spare time which would ultimately become my career. I guess when you're depressed it's easy to hide in the basement playing on the computer all day every day. Shortly after dropping out of college a very lucky series of events occurred. One of my dad's good friends who just happened to be in charge of hiring software developers for a small business gave me an opportunity to come in and interview for a full-time software developer position. So in I went, barely 20 years old, with my only experience being working for a grocery store, fresh from dropping out of college. The interview was a bit awkward to say the least. But... just kidding. No but. They didn't hire me. I was told they hired some hot-shot self-starter with tons of experience instead who was going to hit the ground running and that sounded more appealing than training me as the greenest programmer in the world I suppose. Needless to say I was pretty bummed about this, but (here's the *real* but) if memory serves me, I believe it was no more than about 6 weeks later that I got a call back from the company. They told me that the other guy wasn't working out, he was a bad fit culturally and wound up not being as much of a self-starter as advertised. Point is, he was out, and I was given the opportunity -- literally -- of a lifetime.

I think I received that call on a Friday, and started the next Monday... at $12 per hour. Oh yeah, you read that right. This isn't one of those ""I'm a software engineer making $180k straight out of college"" stories. I grinded this career out to get to where I am now 10 years later, and I'm not exactly the highest paid software engineer even today. I developed a work ethic almost immediately and made a point to always be the nicest guy in the office having heard all the things everybody said about the previous hire. Doing the work was easy since I was naturally interested in programming and had been doing it for fun. That company treated me extremely well. I worked there for 9 years, and only quit about a year ago. When I quit I was making $19/hr, but was making *substantial* profit sharing bonus every year in the range of $20k+. Leaving was one of the hardest decisions of my life because they treated me so well personally and the office culture was so great, but the finances just didn't work out. I had more than earned a fair market value with my years of service, and $19/hr wasn't cutting it, even with the massive profit sharing bonuses. Those bonuses were actually one of the primary motivations for me to leave, because having a bonus sounds nice, but when your bonus comes on a monthly basis and represents ~35% of your take-home pay, it stops feeling like a bonus and starts feeling like a necessity. When the company finally stopped growing and I saw my pay checks dwindle, I knew it was time to go searching for a more fair market value, and I found one. So now I have a stable salary of $72k instead of an incredibly volatile salary of anywhere from $40k-$65k depending on the year, and I feel like I have plenty of room to grow. I should mention I live in Nebraska, so money goes a long way here. $72k is above the curve in general.

My wife's story is basically the polar opposite of mine, so this is going to be short. She has a loving family that are all the nicest most supportive people ever, and she is an absolutely phenomenal student who was always a hard worker with perfect grades. She earned her undergraduate degree in Psychology, and attended graduate school where she earned an Educational Specialist degree, which apparently is slightly more school than a Masters degree, but not as much as a PHD. She just started her career 2 years ago working as a School Psychologist for the local school district here earning about $48k. She worked through school before that doing various jobs like waiting tables and fast food. So until she started her career job, we basically lived on my income.

So the finances as of today are that we have a combined income (gross) of $120k, and we live in the Midwest where it's cheap to live. So it hasn't exactly been difficult to destroy this pile of student loans as quickly as we did.

One big aspect that helped us tremendously is that we've always been a team. I've always earned significantly more than she did, meanwhile all $93k of those student loans were in her name, but this has never for a second been a point of contention for us. We've always been on the same team, and we both are very naturally frugal. 

We of course set a budget, and stuck to it. We cook all our own meals and rarely eat out. We cut the cable 6+ years ago and have been paying only for internet. Both of us have reasonable cars that we paid cash for with no car payments. We both have cheap hobbies, and are in general just allergic to spending money. We joke about how silly it is for us to ""go shopping"" because usually what happens is we'll be bored on a weekend and head to the store knowing that we want to buy something. Then we'll get to the store and scoff at the price tags, and resolve to go home and buy it on Amazon instead. Then we'll sleep on it, and never buy it. 

Oh yeah, and not having kids of course has helped. Probably should have mentioned that earlier.

I've been contributing to a retirement account since I started my career at age 20 and my wife did the same just a few years ago. I'm almost to 6 figures in my retirement!

When she graduated there was immense pressure from friends and family to just rush into buying a house. This was before I got my new job with a more stable salary, but we made the choice to eliminate all the debt first, especially with all the uncertainty with my job.

We've paid Navient apparently ~$5k per month for 18 months. It hurt. But it's done. [Here is my favorite screenshot ever](http://i.imgur.com/WyeQKe4.png)

It feels great to be debt free! Now we're hoping to put that same saving power towards a down payment on a house when our lease is up in ~10 months. And with our new found purchasing power thanks to not having debt, we'll be able to afford any house we could possibly imagine. But of course, we're still going to pick something that's well below our means. Here in Nebraska the most extravagant house I could possibly imagine living in would be in the ~$350k range, so we're shooting for no more than $250k instead.

If you have any other questions, ask away. I'm sure I skipped something.

t5_2qstm,My bank card is repeatedly compromised.  I think I figured out why and I would like advice on how to fix it.,"My bank card is repeatedly compromised.  I think I figured out why and I would like advice on how to fix it. **EDIT 2:**  
Okay thanks everyone for the replies and help.  I'll be turning off notifications for this thread now.  I've downloaded bitwarden and I've changed all my passwords to something unique.  I even set up a new email address for my credit card and 2FA is turned on for all financial stuff.  

  
Obviously I can't go to the bank today but I will on Monday and close my old accounts and start new ones.  Thanks again and I hope everyone has a good weekend.



**EDIT:**

First off, thanks to everyone who replied.  I read just about every reply here and a lot of them were very helpful.  A few things

1. The messages I got from Huntington Fraud did specifically mention it was my card being used and every time it's happened it's been the new card.  I don't know how much of a difference this makes but I've seen some suggest it's my account number rather than my card that was compromised.  It could be, but they're using the card still.  I wasn't just going through my account and noticing weird charges.  They caught them.
2. I don't have an SO or live with anyone.  Furthermore, and I should have mentioned this, but it's always someone way out of my state that uses it and buys weird shit like $50 worth of McDonalds Coffee from Office Depot.  So I'm sure it's no one around me that's getting a hold of my card.
3. I didn't mean to throw shade at the bank teller who said they didn't know how the card was being compromised.  While I understand she wouldn't know how my card specifically was being used, I just thought she might have some information on how to protect myself.  She told me about the card skimmers though and that was certainly insightful.  I had no idea what they were before then and now I know what to look for.  My mom was a bank teller for many MANY years in her life, and believe me, I know they deal with stupid people a lot.  My favorite story she told me was about the guy who came up angry that he was overdrawn and then proceeded to say that was impossible because he ""still had checks left.""  So i guess I was the stupid person this time.
4. To everyone saying ""Why is OP using a debit card??!!?!!?!?!! This makes no sense.  Everyone knows you never use a debit card and only use credit!!111!"" and acting like I'm a moron... well, growing up in the 80s before debit cards were a common thing, I was always told that credit cards were for emergencies only and you should only use it if you need to.  That has stuck with me but I see now that things have changed and using a credit card is the better option.  And it makes a lot of sense too.

And I know I'm going to get a bunch of replies now that say ""I grew up in the 80s and never used a debit card in my entire life!!!?????!"" but at least where I grew up, credit cards were emergencies only because of interest and the fact that it was easy to rack up debt with them.  But as I said, things have changed. Just try to understand that maybe someone was taught something different and that doesn't mean they're stupid.

Most people I know has had their card compromised at least once in their life, that's why I said ""it happens sometimes.""  If it hasn't happened to you... well that's great.  I hope it doesn't happen to you.  I'm 43 now but I was 42 when this happened and i went that long with it only ever happening one other time 10 years ago so... I'd say I had a good run. I've heard of it happening to people who haven't even activated their card yet so... sometimes weird shit happens.

Also with the invention of chip cards, they were supposed to be insanely secure and you just tap and go and no information is sent.  I never swipe my card, I only ever use chip and that was supposed to be the way to go.  You hear that all these things are secure and you can trust this and that and only do it this or that way, and sometimes it's hard to tell what's really secure and what isn't.

5.  To people saying ""Stop using your debit card everywhere!""... I'm being honest when I say that the latest card I got I barely used.  I never entered it anywhere online or on my phone and never swiped it anywhere and changed my pin and everything.  So, I'm really at a loss as to how someone was able to use it.  My best guess is the auto update thing.

6.

A.  I will be closing down my bank accounts and opening new ones.

B.  I will keep my debit card locked unless I need to use it for withdrawals.  I'll use my credit card and pay it off once a week now and keep an eye on it.

C.  I have a password manager now and I'm in the process of changing all my passwords and enable 2FA on everything

D.  I would like to check my computer for malware and would like suggestions on the best one to use.  I want to check my phone too but I've never entered my card information on my phone.

And I think that's about it.  If it happens again, I will change banks.  I just don't want to do that now since I've been with Huntington for so long and they've always caught the fraud charges right away and reversed the charges.  I'm worried that if I go to a new bank it won't be as easy but hopefully it just doesn't happen anymore.

Again, thanks for all the replies.  I appreciate all the help and will do everything I can to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

Original post:

So hi there r/personalfinance  redditors.  I'm not 100% certain if this is the correct subreddit to post to but when I looked up information on what I was going through, this subreddit came up a lot.

First off, I know everyone probably says this but I do consider myself careful with bank cards.  I very rarely if at all use them online.  I usually pay with paypal.  If I do use a bank card, I don't have google auto save it, but again, usually I don't.  I only ever use tap as well.  I don't swipe my card anywhere.

So back in June, my bank card was compromised.  Huntington caught it right away and put a stop on it.  Not a big deal to me, it happens to everyone, although the last time it happened it was like 10 years ago.

I got a new card but then two months later, again, charges on the card that I didn't do.  I stopped the card again and this time when I went into Huntington I asked them how that could be.  It seemed crazy to me that my card could be compromised twice in a short period of time.  The lady there told me it could be a card skimmer at a gas station nearby.  She also says she sees this happens sometimes where someone will have their card hacked several time in a short amount of time and they don't know why.

I got a new card and this time I was careful.  I didn't even activate it for like two weeks because now I was nervous.  When I did activate, I didn't use it much as I used to.  I either paid cash or used my credit card.  When I did use the bank card, again, I would tap, never swipe.  I even examined the gas stations i went to to see if there were skimmers, but found none.

Then last week, once again, charges on the card that weren't mine.  I also got an email about an order someone placed on officedepot using my email address.  (it was a bunch of coffee so I guess this person is tired)

At this point I was just completely at a loss and didn't know what to do.  I thought to myself that i wouldn't even bother getting a new one, BUT I took to the internet anyway to look up why this could happen.

I came across two things

1. Skimmers.  It could be a skimmer somewhere or....
2. Apparently if a website with your card information is breached, it's easy for them to get the new card information when you get it.

Neither of these made sense to me and I couldn't figure out which website could have the card info until now.  I was going through old emails and I found one I missed from Ticketmaster...

yes, I had used them and put my card information in.  I went to the Sonic Symphony this year.  I'm sure that's how they got my name, email and card number and such.

But, the thing is... I don't know how to fix this.  I don't want to just not have a bank card, just in case but I don't want to have to change it every 2 months.... so my plan was to close my bank accounts and open new ones with a new email address.

Will that be enough?  Is there something else I need to do?  Sorry for the long post, I guess I got a little carried away but I wanted to lay all the facts out.  Let me know, thanks.",[50.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fwjxqy/my_bank_card_is_repeatedly_compromised_i_think_i/
t5_2qstm,Paying cash for a car. Dealership wants 100% of the money BEFORE the car even arrives. Is that normal?,"Paying cash for a car. Dealership wants 100% of the money BEFORE the car even arrives. Is that normal? I'm actually helping a friend who hasn't purchased a car in a long time. She is decided on a Corolla Cross Hybrid and has found one at a Toyota dealership in the area that is for MSRP and has the exact options she wants. She will be paying for the vehicle 100% cash, and the salesman knows this now. The salesman sent her the spec sheet on it including VIN number, cost breakdown and the total cost .. everything looks good. The car should arrive at the dealership at the end of November or early December.

The only problem is that they are requesting 100% payment NOW to reserve the car. I spoke with the salesman on the phone and he said his dealership has been doing things this way for the past 3 years and it is normal. When pressed for a reason why, he gave me some lame answer saying that other dealerships ""that will remain nameless"" take a deposit of $500, but then when the car arrives they sell it to the highest bidder. I told him that that sounds like a dealership problem, so if you are honest then just take the deposit and my friend will pay in full when she goes to pick up the vehicle. Anyway, he didn't agree and said doing it 100% in full now protects both the dealership and the customer.

Any thoughts? Should my friend walk from this deal?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the comments everyone. I've passed on the overall sentiment contained here in the chat and I'm pretty sure my friend is going to pass and wait for a car from a different dealership. She's not in a hurry so she has time on her side.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Well this story has a happy ending. I earlier in a comment stated that I called the Toyota dealership where I recently bought a car from a few months back asking their advice on this situation. My original salesman told me the same thing ... do NOT pay the money and walk. He then told me he would check again their inventory because they just got an allocation. Even though my friend had already talked to this dealership recently, my old salesman called me back later this morning and said they have the EXACT same car (same color, model, packages), but get this, a 2024 instead of the 23', and the price was the exact same to the dollar ($30,034 including delivery, but not tax). My friend just put down a $500 deposit. Car will take an extra month to arrive (late December) but she's in no hurry. Thanks again for all the feedback!

&#x200B;

Edit 3: I just texted briefly with my friend. She said the dealership called her this afternoon asking if she was ready to go through with the deal. When she told him she already put a deposit down on another vehicle that didn't require paying 100% in advance he asked her if she wanted to pay partial cash now and finance the rest (I assume once the car arrived??). She said .... uuummm .. NO.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: I just called the dealership myself and spoke to the salesman that I spoke to this morning (this morning I was on a three-way-call with my friend and the salesman). He was actually very nice and still stuck with their policy of needing 100% upfront to reserve the car. Regarding paying part in cash and part with financing, he said that would still require that she pay 100% now ... just a percentage cash and a percentage financing. (Not sure how the financing department would feel about giving a loan for a car that hasn't arrived but he assured me they do it all the time). He agreed that a lot of people don't feel comfortable buying a car this way. It actually sucks for him too as the salesman because he has to stick to this dealership policy which makes his job harder.

So the treatment concluded at the end of 2014 and I leave for another dentist. Fast forward to the middle of 2015 and I received a bill for a past due payment of $239 dollars. I called the office twice and left 2 voicemails. In the second voicemail I said I think the bill is a mistake, if you need any help clearing it up please call me.

Fast forward to yesterday. Some of my old mail goes to my parents home and I picked up yesterday. In the bundle was a bill from a different dentist for $239 with a handwritten note saying ""your immediate attention is required"". 

So I called them this morning and it turns out the dentist changed names and locations. After clarifying that I told them it isn't possible to have a balance, I paid each visit in full before leaving. The woman on the phone said that the whiting wasn't covered by insurance, and I only paid $500 of the $739. I said again, that isn't possible, I paid every visit in full.

She told me that I need to prove to her I made the payments and she would apologize and fix my account. I asked her when my last visit was and she couldn't tell me ""she didn't have that information"". She rushed me off the phone and told me she would call me back when she wasn't so busy.

I save my old bank statements and was able to dig up the ones from 9/14,10/14, and 12/14 which show me making payments of $239, $250, and $239. 

With proof I called them back and they didn't answer. I called back again and left a voicemail. I called back again and it made the noise like a fax machine. Any other office and I wouldn't have a problem but this office has done this before with not answering the phone. I don't want to get a call from collections saying I owe them money in a few months time. My wife and I are looking to buy a home soon so my credit score can't take a hit because of this foolishness. They are only 30 minutes away. Should I drive to them and speak to them in person? What would happen if they send me to collections? Even though I am in the right could it negatively impact my credit?

TL;DR I paid for the dentist in full, 3 separate payments. Dentist doesn't have record of one of the payments and has sent me bills for the services performed in 2014. My bank statements prove I made all the payments. I keep calling them and they won't answer.


**Edit:** thanks for all of your responses! I have off from work tomorrow so I will be going in to the office in person. 


**Edit 2:** Thanks for all the advice and feedback. Also thank you for the PM's telling me I couldn't count. I did make a mistake in my initial post, my payments were $250, $250, and $239, those 3 payments along with an $11 bill credit from a previous over-payment totaled the $750 procedure. 


I drove to the new dentist today and the office was really nice, but it smelled like Burger King. I had no idea why, but it didn't matter to me because I just wanted this done. I brought with me my account statements from September, October, and December of 2014. The woman at the front desk tried to make copies of them and I stopped her. The paperwork had my account number and I wasn't letting her copy that. 

I had them print out a full account summary of all services and payments during my entire run with the dentist. I then requested a print out of the final bill, totaling $0.00 owed. After she bit into her burger, she printed the bill for me confirming that I now owe them nothing and their system has been updated.

So, there are really two victories here. I get to wash my hands of them with proof I owe them nothing, and I found out why a dentist would smell like burgers. 

Thanks for all your advice!!","[750.0, 239.0, 239.0, 500.0, 739.0, 239.0, 250.0, 239.0, 250.0, 250.0, 239.0, 11.0, 750.0, 0.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uj8sb/i_received_a_bill_from_my_old_dentist_for/

Car runs and drives just fine but recently got check engine light on due to the transmission stuff. I got the car for free from my father

So I’m looking to buy a new car that has more technology like Apple carplay, rear camera, blind spot detection etc…

Car I’m looking for is 24 WRX limited around $36k with $11k down for $400/month with 3.9apr/72 months. I like the WRX because it’s AWD and I want to learn manual as well. 

The thing is we just bought a house that we are paying $5000/month on mortgage, another $560/m for our highlander, plus utilies, food and stuff will cost us around $7000/month. 

We together make around $9500 after tax a month, so I don’t know if I’m being stupid with financial buying a car right now? Should I just keep driving the camry until it dies, and save as much as I can later for a new car? I feel like driving the camry is very boring and I’m a car guy so I want to drive something fun. Can you guys help me on this?

**Renters Insurance is a HUGE bargain, might not even cost anything.**

&nbsp;

Renters insurance covers quite a few things, including:

* Coverage for your personal content, even if it’s not in your home (eg: items in your car. Certain limits apply for traveling and storage). I typically see this coverage at 10k+
* Coverage if you are temporarily displaced,( eg: you need to stay at a hotel while your house is being repaired for smoke damage, money to replace lost clothes, increased food expenses because you’re eating out every day since you don’t have a stove, etc.) I typically see this coverage at 30% the above number
* Coverage for liability (eg: someone falls in your apartment and breaks their leg, sues you for negligence). I typically see this at 300k
* Coverage for your defense costs (eg: lawyer fees, small allowance if you need to miss work to attend court hearings, etc.) This is included.

And how much does this coverage cost (including the numbers I used above)? Usually under $200; I typically see 150, but I have seen it go as low as 90. PLUS, if you bundle your renters and auto, sometimes the discount on auto will cover the renters (eg:$200 savings on auto, renters cost 150, net savings: 50.) Call your auto insurance, ask if they have renters. If it’s too much, say thank you and call the next agency.

&nbsp;

What would a worst case scenario look like? Well, try /r/legaladvice, browse around for a bit. For the lazy, imagine you accidentally start a small house fire while cooking. It damages a few thousand dollars’ worth of your stuff, plus you have to live in a hotel while it’s being repaired, and your landlord is going after you for damages because he has to pay for the repairs. If you don’t have renters insurance, you’ll be paying all of that out of pocket. Oh, but if you DO have renters insurance? You’re paying the deductible (typically 250 or 500), and then letting your claims adjuster deal with everything else. Have to take time off work to go to court to prove you’re not negligent? They have you covered.

&nbsp;

**Higher Deductibles will save you more money, especially over the long run**

&nbsp;

General rule: At LEAST $500 deductible on your auto, preferably $1k. For homeowners insurance, it’s best to go with at LEAST $1k, preferably 2.5k or even 5k. Renters can get away with 250 or 500, honestly.

&nbsp;

Why?

&nbsp;

The difference is usually several hundred a year, and you pay the deductible before the insurance pays anything. 

&nbsp;

I go into this a little more later, but say for example your insurance is 1500 a year with a 1k deductible, and 900 a year with a 2.5k. After 4 years, with a 1k deductible, you’ve paid 6000 to the insurance company, and then you’ll have to pay another 1k in the event of a claim. After 4 years with a 2.5 deductible, you’ve paid 3600  to the insurance company, and put aside 2400 that would have gone to the insurance company, so basically covered your deductible. One more year, you can use the $600 you’ve saved to cover the deductible with $500 additional savings to do whatever you’d like.

&nbsp;

**Insurance should only be used in an emergency/making claims will increase your rates**

&nbsp;

This is the one that gets people the most. You pay 1500 a year for insurance, you’ve been paying the last ten years, so why shouldn’t you make a claim when you’ve already paid then 15k? Because it’s going to raise your rates.

&nbsp;

Why?

&nbsp;

If you don’t make any claims, you’re put in a group, “unlikely to make a claim”. Because you’re in that group, you get more favorable rates. If you make a claim, you automatically switch to a different group, “likely to make a claim.” Because you’re in this group, you’ll get less favorable rates. On auto, it will last for 3 years; on home, five. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t made a claim in your entire LIFE up until this point; as far as the insurance company can see if, you’ve made a claim and will be much more likely to make another.

&nbsp;

For example: Let’s say you have a 1k deductible.  Someone breaks into your car, steals your purse worth 1500. Personal property is covered by your home/renters, so if you make a claim your home will pay out $500 (cost of loss-deductible). They now see you as riskier, so they will increase your rates. Maybe $300 a year for the next 5 years; you’ll pay $1500 over the next five years, plus you’ve already paid the $1000 deductible, so now you’ve paid $2500 for a $1500 purse. In this case, it will cost you less to just buy a new purse out of pocket.

&nbsp;

On the other hand, if you have a kitchen fire that does $30k in damage? Yeah, make a claim on that one.
 
&nbsp;

**Most vehicles don’t need “full coverage”**
 
&nbsp;

Unless A) Your vehicle is financed, then it’s required by your financing company, or B) Your vehicle is less than 10 years old, then your vehicle will pay out more. 
 
&nbsp;

Why?  

&nbsp;

* Full coverage isn’t an industry regulated term. Professionally, it means nothing. It usually includes collision and comprehensive coverage; some companies will also throw in towing, glass, and rental.  If you ask for full coverage, you could be getting anything.
* Your policy will typically only pay out collision if you’re at fault. If the other driver is at fault, their insurance will pay out.  Comprehensive does cover more, so you can get away with having comprehensive (vandalism, theft, tree falls, hit deer) but no collision (you hit object)
* We will only pay out what the vehicle is worth. Not what it costs to get a new vehicle of this type, not what it costs to get a used vehicle of this type. Doesn’t matter if you paid $35k for the vehicle 10 years ago, doesn’t matter if it costs $15k ro replace it today, we’re only going to pay out the Actual Cash Value, and it typically isn’t 15/35k on a 10 year old vehicle (Much more common is less than 5k)
* You actually end up paying the company more than it would pay you in the event of a claim, because “full coverage” costs more than liability only.
 
&nbsp;

For example:

&nbsp;
 
Let’s say you have a buy a vehicle in 2001 for $20k. ACV is 3k. Your insurance is 1000 liability only, 1500 with collision and comprehensive, with a 1k deductible. Over the course of 4 years here’s what your insurance totals will look like:

&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;|Liability only | Full coverage
----|----|----
1|	1000|	1500 (500 extra)
2|	2000|	3000 (1k extra)
3|	3000|	4500 (1.5k extra)
4|	4000|	7000 (2k extra).
 

&nbsp;

Liability is what you have to pay anyways, so unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do to get around that. For the collision and comp, you’ve paid out 2k extra over the years. If you have an accident right now, the ACV is 3k, minus deductible (in this case 1k). So the most they’ll pay out is 2k, which is the amount you’ve paid them, so you break even. Ever year after that that you don’t have an accident, you’re paying them money that you will never get.

&nbsp;


The exact amounts vary, which is why I have the general rules A and B above. If you’re not entirely sure, find out the rough value of what your vehicle is worth. Price liability only coverage (that’s coverage if you hit someone), and liability+ collision and comprehensive coverage (coverage if you hit someone, and also for your own vehicle).  Take the rough value of your vehicle, subtract your deductible, this is X. Then take (the price of your quote with collision and comprehensive) and subtract (the price of your quote with liability only). This is Y. X divided by Y is how long it will take you to “break even” if you were to have an accident (although this is obviously not the goal).

t5_2qstm,For 5 years we have tracked every single transaction in and out of our accounts using YNAB. The results are revealing.,"For 5 years we have tracked every single transaction in and out of our accounts using YNAB. The results are revealing. Hi all, I was reading a post on another sub of someone sharing their expenses for last year when it got me thinking about my own and it hit me: this month marks 5 years that my wife and I have been using YNAB! So I decided to take some time and reflect and figured I would share. By all means let me know if there are things I miss in this data!

For starters, wow what an absolute change 5 years has made and not just financially. YNAB itself brought upon us the concept of budgeting and tracking out finances when up until that point our lives had consisted of a ""buy it, figure out how to pay for it later"" mentality. Thankfully we were never really big spenders so we started from a decent spot. Secondly, looking at this it's relatively easy for me to see life changes along the way. From renting to mortgage, from having non-mortgage debt to having none. Life uh, finds a way. 

Let's start at the top and look at total spending over the past 5 years https://imgur.com/LVlo2DY

Nearly $500k, ouch. Breaking it down further though it looks like 32% of that went to Savings which is our largest top-level category followed by Monthly bills(ouch again). Debt was a pain and everyday expenses really added up as well. Instead of looking at raw totals though I think taking a look at how things have changed over time is better https://imgur.com/geobw9v

Apologies but it looks like YNAB does not include a legend so here is what the colors mean:

* Red - Monthly bills
* Orange - Everyday Expenses
* Green(Beige?) - Savings
* Blue - Debt 

A couple of trends/events I am able to pluck out of this:

* Non-mortgage debt was eliminated mid-2018(yay) meaning up until that point it was much more than a 17% expense that the totals had shown
* Monthly bills were pretty bang on until mid 2016. Correlates with a cross country move. Everyday Expenses took a beating for a couple of months as well 
* Monthly expenses spiked in mid 2017 and haven't really come down. This reflects the transition from renting to owning
* Savings is highly irregular. Spikes I can mostly explain as IRA contributions.. but the more frequent minor irregularties not so much The last couple of years the bulk of the savings comes in the first couple months of a new year when contributions can be made

That provides a pretty good high-level overview, let's take a peak at the 4 different master categories individually. Starting with savings
https://imgur.com/pfTyopB

Sounds about right, looks like IRA contributions have made up about 50% of the category. I'm also assuming this has some 2014 contributions in there as well given the totals. After that the totals seem to get a bit smaller with other things we have saved up for including purchasing a home, going on vacation, gifting and donating and thankfully we really haven't had to use our emergency fund all that much in the last 5 years! Woohoo. What in the world is going on with Services/appliances/Electronics though? I did a little digging and it looks like it mostly breaks down thus:
* $15k landscaping and house projects
* $5.5k ""we bought a house now we need a washer/dryer/lawn mower etc. for it""
* $5k one-time luxury purchases
* $4k electronics (phone's/TV/routers etc.)
* $2k furniture
* $2k misc services (plumbers/chimney sweepers etc.)

I would not have guessed we spent that much on electronics. Holy hell. :\ Moving on to the next category: Monthly bills https://imgur.com/iaHtkvS

Right off the bat: putting a roof over our heads is expensive. To the tune of nearly 82% of the entire category over the last 5 years. Second observation.. these subcategories are all over the place. ""Electricity"" and ""Utilities""? Oh right.. we basically got lazy sometime in 2016 and decided to stop tracking electricity and lump it in with gas/garbage/water in the ""utilities"" category. Looking closer at utilities: 

* Nearly $4.5k is from LP.. which just began in 2017 with the home purchase. We need to switch, that's ridiculous!
* Another $1k in natural gas for the previous 2 years(MUCH CHEAPER)
* Rest mostly electric with water/trash combining for not even $50/month over the period

Nothing else too exciting about this category. Next up.. every day expenses https://imgur.com/leMPHm7

This one I'm kind of proud of. This is where I feel like we have a lot of control over our spending. Right off the bat, our largest expense is groceries consuming nearly a quarter of the entire subcategories cost. Over 5 years though, that comes out to around $400/month. Not too shabby if I do say so myself! The next highest, homegoods is a bit high for my liking as is miscellaneous but they are what they are I suppose. For our budgeting homegoods is basically things like cleaning supplies, paper products, decorations, health and beauty and so on. Misc are things like car registrations, haircuts, credit card fees, amazon prime etc. For the last year we have only budgeted $50 a month for this category, although looking at purchases from a few years ago it looks like we were just throwing random junk in here that belongs better elsewhere. Maybe I'm not so proud of this master category. Oh well, live and learn I suppose! Last observation: pets are cheap, awesome. Sub categories are clothing/work expenses/and laundry from when we used to have to go to a laundromat.

Now the last category, and my least favorite: debt https://imgur.com/bytFahV

As previously mentioned this was tracking non-mortgage debt. That came down to 2 types for us, a car loan and the dreaded student loans. Actually, I think this category is the one to be the most proud of. We paid off $70k in student loan debt in 3 years. Hell ya. I know that there was at least another $30k dent put in the 3 years before that as well. Took longer than we had hoped, but in the end it's good to have that boat anchor off of our necks. Other than that, not really much to see/say for this category. 

Well.. this post got uh.. long and a bit of rambling. I apologize. I more or less did this live. A couple of big takeaways.

* Tracking your spending like this not only has the power to change your behavior and life, it also allows you to reflect on the life changes that occur and how they impact your finances. The spending over time chart is my favorite I think
* Refinement along the way is key. When you begin your budget categories may be too granular for you or not granular enough. Tweak as you go and keep moving forward
* There are always things you can do better and things you rock at. Your assumptions may not always match the facts. The way to tell is to first have the data and secondly to analyze. Short of that you're just guessing. I know I wish I had started sooner to see what the 5 years before this looked like
* Plan long term where able with your budget. This is not reflected in the numbers posted, but initially we used to plan 1-month ahead in our budget. Then we need a new car. Or furniture. Or <insert expensive thing we had not saved for over the last x months>. The result: scrambling to find the money and spiking the funding of a subcategory for that month in order to cover the expense. Now we try to plan ahead all of those purchases, even the ones that are many years out like a new vehicle so we can spread the cost out over time
* 5 years is a loooong time.","[500.0, 15.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.0, 50.0, 400.0, 50.0, 70.0, 30.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f83u0y/for_5_years_we_have_tracked_every_single/
t5_2qstm,"""You're doing it wrong!"" Personal finance pitfalls to avoid (US)","""You're doing it wrong!"" Personal finance pitfalls to avoid (US) You're doing it wrong!  Not you, singular; but you, collectively.  Among you, there are people undermining their personal wealth by doing things that seem like good ideas, but, in hindsight...don't really work out that way.

Here are ten things you might be doing, and why not to do them.  (We've covered some of these in other posts, so this is primarily a handy checklist.)   If you are not doing any of these, take a victory lap!

1.  **Spending more than you make**.  No explanation needed.  Don't do that!  Even if you like buying things, or don't have much income, or hope to get a better job soon.  Make a budget, and stick to it.  Make automatic savings contributions before you even look at your checking account balance.  Establish and maintain an emergency fund.  If you rely on a payday loan to avoid eviction, you're doing it wrong.

2.  **Financing a car that is [too expensive](http://genxfinance.com/your-car-is-making-you-poor-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/)**.   For example, one that costs almost as much as your annual take-home pay.  Even if it's really cool, or one you've always wanted, or you want a warranty.  Please don't do that.  You can't afford it; you'll be underwater and can't pay off the loan even if you sell the car; your insurance will be too expensive.  You can get a reliable used car for under $10,000.   

3.  **Carrying a balance on your interest-bearing credit card**, because you think it [improves your credit history / score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/credit-score-does-carrying-a-balance-help/). It doesn't.  You just pay interest.  You want to use a card to generate positive history, but you also want to pay off an interest-accruing card in full.  Every month.  No exceptions.  And yes, that means you can't use credit to finance your lifestyle (see point 1).  

4.  **Taking out a loan to establish your credit history**.  You do not have to do that, when you can do the same thing with a credit card that you pay no interest on.  Taking out a car loan as your first credit transaction is a very expensive mistake.  A car loan with a double-digit interest rate means you are doing it wrong. 

5. **Not taking the match from your 401k**.  Even if you watched John Oliver's show about 401k fees and you are now a born-again mutual fund expense watcher...please, please take any match your employer gives in your 401k.  Even if the fund choices have 2% fees, it's still free money.  Even if you have expensive credit card debt, which you shouldn't, the match is probably still the right move.  You could be making 50% one-time gain on your money; that will cover a lot of fees.  

6. **[Cashing out retirement funds](http://www.rothira.com/blog/never-cash-out-retirement-accounts-when-switching-jobs)** to pay for things, or when you change jobs. This is almost never a good idea.  Even if you can do it, you shouldn't.  That $20,000 in the 401k from the job you just left looks like it might be a good way to make a down payment on a house.  Don't be tempted.  It will be much more valuable to you as $100,000+ when you retire, than as the $12,000 you'd be left with after paying taxes and penalties on it in the 25% federal and 5% state bracket.  

7.  Buying a house only to avoid **[throwing away money](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-nonsense-of-rent-vs-buy-myths-that-ruined-the-housing-market/)** on rent.   You need to live somewhere.  Renting is almost always cheaper if you aren't sure where you want to live two, three or even five years in the future.  Your transaction costs to purchase and then sell a property are ""thrown away"", as are your payment towards interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs. (Renting it out later isn't as easy or profitable as it sounds, either.)  Even in a hot market, appreciation is not guaranteed, and major repair expenses are not always avoidable.   Buy a house if you can afford to, and you know you want to live somewhere indefinitely, not to save on monthly payments.  [Edit: owning a house is financially better as you own it longer.  Over a short interval, monthly payment calculations alone are not enough to prove ownership is financially better than renting.]

8.  **Co-signing loans you shouldn't**.  While there can be some limited reasons to co-sign a loan, e.g. for your child, never co-sign a loan just because your significant other has no credit, or your parents want a better interest rate.  If they need a co-signer, it's because they are a poor credit risk.  Once you co-sign, you are on the hook for the whole balance, even if you don't have access to what the money went towards.  

9.  **Paying a financial planner to invest your money in a mutual fund with a [5% up-front fee](http://www.fool.com/school/mutualfunds/costs/loads.htm)**.  Despite what you might have been told, this is never necessary, and doesn't help you in any way.  You can buy alternatives with no up-front fees, and lower ongoing expenses.  

10. **Buying [whole life insurance](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/04/is-whole-life-insurance-right-for-you/index.htm)** from someone you knew in college  to ""jump-start your financial future"", even if you have no dependents.  You do not even need life insurance until you have responsibilities after your death.  If and when you do have them, term life insurance is much more cost-effective.  Politely decline the invitation to a free financial planning session from your old fraternity brother.  

I hope you found this helpful, and you didn't see yourself in any of these.  Extra points if you can use these to help your friends and family as well!

t5_2qstm,Looking for advice to help with my son's future. (Long),"Looking for advice to help with my son's future. (Long) First some background.

My son(40m) has Asperger's Syndrome, because of our lack of understand or diagnoses earlier in his life, he was unable to finish school or get the skills and help necessary to have a job or really even function well. At this point in his life, I am told that he will most likely never have a job/family, will be lucky to even have friends. His mother and I have always taken care of him and his needs, but we divorced in 2008 and have since retired. Since his mother and I were both ""blue"" collar workers, we don't have a whole lot of money.

But because of the assistance of some great doctors advice and them helping get us connected with the right people, we were able to get him properly diagnosed and took the suggestion of applying for disability for him. He has been on disability for about 4 years and we have saved nearly every dollar to try and make up for the past. He lives with me and we have enough money to do okay, but I won't live forever and his mother get's less money than I do and has some health issues that would make it very difficult for him to live with her.

Now, he's not incapable of taking care of himself, his major issues is his ability to deal with any kind of social interaction. Even writing an email causes noticeable anxiety in him. But with online stores and ordering and bill paying and such, I think he could live on his own with some reasonable discomfort and anxiety at times.

He gets about $9k a year from disability. We've managed to save about $45k by adding some of our money and saving nearly all of his disability. He has a PA ABLE account to save money in, but we just opened that this year and it will take time to get the money into the account (limits $15k a year). I mention that because, when we die he will qualify for SSI  and that with his disability should be livable with his minor needs and the ABLE account allows him to save money without it counting against SSI. This is the best we can do, life insurance for me(lifetime smoker and 70) or his mother(disabled now, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer survivor) is just too expensive and we need to being saving for our own funeral requirements so as not to burden him or his two sisters. We have no more money to add and I need half the money he gets to cover his expenses.

He's never had a vacation, a girlfriend, has no friends and we have no money or property to leave him.  Ultimately I would love to be able to give him something like a normal life. At least the ability to enjoy what little things he can, without having to live in abject poverty his whole life. I know he will qualify for things like food stamps and public housing, but housing won't help since living in an apartment building(all that's available anywhere even near here) would be torture to him. the sounds and having to deal with all those people just to get in and out. Or shared laundry facilities, kids, and the smells. Even seriously considering buying a house and taking a mortgage this late in life and squeezing our finances even further if it will help his future comfort/sanity. He lives a life I wouldn't even call a life and couldn't have survived myself.

&#x200B;

Goals:

Get him as much money as I can before his mother and I die.

Get him the ability to live as comfortably for his needs as possible.

Get his some measure of disposable income to enjoy what little he can.

Make it sustainable for his lifetime.

&#x200B;

Average U.S death age is 78 right now, my parents lived to be 81 and 93. So baring accident or illness, I think I can make 78 or more as I'm in fairly good health. He would get about another $9k from SSI if he qualifies and gets the full amount. But $18k a year, with his needs and being single is definitely not a lot. I would like to find a way that I can either skip counting on SSI for him in the future and get him to maybe $25k a year with enough increase over time for inflation. Or count on that SSI and find a way to make as much as I can each year on the money before I put it into the ABLE account. I am not well educated and I know of ""higher"" finance, so if anyone has more suggestions, I'm all ears.

&#x200B;

Thanks for all that read through and made it this far. And a further thanks to any and all that comment to help me get even a little closer to the goals I have set.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

   First off, I want to thank all of you for your information and comments. I was expecting maybe a few replies and some sources for me to look into later, but what I didn't expect was all the support and personal experiences. Maybe I am just becoming cynical in my old age. But I really appreciate it, thank you.

  Second, for more information, I live in eastern Pennsylvania. I have already applied for basically everything I could find/think of for him for government services. Unfortunately he doesn't qualify for most as he lives with me and together our income is too high, or because he wasn't diagnosed before the age of 26(I think it is). 

  As for his sisters, I am leaving it up to them for how much they want to help him. He is my kid and the youngest, I don't want them to be burdened by him and resent or mistreat him for anything. And it's been my experience that family will take you more for granted than anyone. They are 10 years and 2 years older than he is. The oldest helped babysit the younger kids and such when growing up and I think even that was a little much for us to put on her. The oldest, right after having her first child, had to have her gallbladder removed and scarring and complications for just having birth left her with health issues for nearly two decades afterward. She would be able to work some, then have to go to John's Hopkins and have drainage tubes put in and such. So she is just now, in the last 10 years of so been able to get her life on track. So while I believe she will help her brother with his life going forward(if she can), she doesn't have much in the way of resources, other than time, to commit to it. And the other sister, I guess from having been raised with a sibling that needed more attention/leeway doesn't have a good relationship with her brother. Neither want to even interact with each other.

  As for my son, he does fairly well at taking care of himself. He has some difficulty with laundry and cooking, but other than that he does just fine. For the cooking, he just doesn't know what to eat. He's not like some on with ASD that will only eat one thing until they burn themselves out, just that he doesn't seem to feel cravings for anything. It seems more important to him that he has a meal when he's hungry and it's not something he specifically doesn't like. And the laundry is mostly just because he gets distracted and forgets that the buzzer went off. So he ends up with wrinkled clothes and instead of taking a few hours, it takes all day. Which if it's just him is fine, I figure if he does it, even if it's slow, at least he does it. As for things like bill paying or looking things up online and ordering them, he is vastly better at it than I am. He helps me find stuff online all the time and to get it at the best price. He can setup appointments for himself too, online is best, but he can call and get a dentist appointment. It's just really anxiety inducing for him.

  My biggest worry for him taking care of himself isn't the day to day stuff, it's the times he would have to call and spend 2 hours on the phone getting a cable bill corrected. I've seen him anxious for a doctors appointment 2 months before the date, or pacing for 20 minutes because I asked him to write out a question online for me. Sometimes even getting up in the middle of it to put his thoughts in order. But taking care of the basics, he is fine with.

  And last, but not least, him working. My son looks completely normal, when he's with me or his family, he mostly acts pretty normal. So people often just treat him that way when in public, taking awhile to realize that he's not looking them in the eye or sometimes even at them. Or keeps moving away from them or doesn't say anything but short answers when directly asked. Because of that, we've had a lot of trouble when he was younger interacting with people when out. He would lose it sometimes, or disappear and we'd find him sitting in the car. After all these years, he doesn't just run away anymore, but if I stay and talk to someone too long, it has it's effects on him. Everything from sweating and fidgeting to physical illness. And while I would like him to get a GED, even if it's ""just encase"". or get a simple job, I am worried on the toll it would take. And even if I could say for certain it would work out for him and he'd be more independent and confidant, it took almost 6 years of trial and error and advice and interactions to get him on disability. Doctors appointments, interviews, records finding and gathering, trips to social security and more independent doctors and reviews and then, finally, a judge to put all his future on. If he loses that and there isn't someone serious and passionate as well as having a LOT of time to put into it. I can't see him getting it again. And I don't want my son to be another mental health victim on the street or getting arrested and put in jail. I've seen it too much and America seems to be getting worse for mental health, rather than better.

  As for all who have spoken so kindly about me, I appreciate the sentiment and well wishes and wish you well in return.","[9.0, 45.0, 15.0, 9.0, 18.0, 25.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i4qm0v/looking_for_advice_to_help_with_my_sons_future/
t5_2qstm,Stay in rental house we pay peanuts for? Or make the leap and buy a house...?,"Stay in rental house we pay peanuts for? Or make the leap and buy a house...? Hi PF!  
  
So me and sister live in a rental house that we pay peanuts for, because the landlords are old family friends and only charge us the amount of taxes on the house. It's a wonderful deal and they are wonderful people for letting us stay here for years.  
  
Sisters BF has moved in with us and we split the rent/ bills 3 ways as of about a year ago.  
  
My BF of two years would love to buy a house, and we recently had the ""big"" talk about our future and marriage/ kids, all that stuff, and we are on pretty much the same page, and I am over the moon about it.  
  
He has 30K saved up for a house DP... (I have nothing saved, due to paying off credit, but I am about to be in a wayyyy better place in about 6 months after the last debt is paid off (throwing all of my $ at it)  
  
We will both have about $2200 a month extra cash after bills, after about May (barring any unforeseen emergencies)  
  
What is the smartest move here?  
  
He could move in with me here, and save more for the DP and maybeeee wait for house market to get better? (lol)  
  
he buys what he can now, and I keep my address here where I am now, and I either contribute to his ""rent"" and we combine later after we have lived together and are sure we are all in? (I am practical (I think), and I know sometimes things don't work out, and I don't want him to feel pressured or screw him over at all, and I know it can get messy with partners living together and finances...)  
  
Get married in a few months and buy what we can afford together... I like this one best, but it's also the scariest lol. I am kind of hesitant to leave this house here because of the amazing deal we are getting... (and the fact it is an awesome house with land in north DFW) (would loooove to buy this one but it's sitting at about 1.5M right now lol)  
  
Of course I would love our lives to be entwined together in the long run, but we have kind of just talked about this, and I certainly don't want to rush into anything, or make him feel rushed in any way.  
  
He currently lives with his parents though, to save up house DP money, and I know he is ready to get out.  
  
So I guess, should we live here together with meager rent for a year or two and save together for a while? Or wait a few months (I think proposal is in the cards within a few months 🥰) and then go all in together and get what we can?  
  
The only reason I am trepidations about both living here is the spacing arrangements. I sort of just have one big room as 'my area', and we both respect each others alone time and privacy. I would need to figure out some way to have an area that he could feel like was his own space. I go to bed early and get up early most days and I certainly don't expect him to cater to whatever I need/want to do so I would want him to feel like he has his own space he can go to.  
  
Anyways, that is a big ramble, but honestly I am so freaking excited for whatever we do. Finally having the big talk about everything has got me all a flutter about the future, but my type A mind goes right to the 'nitty gritty details"" like that....  
  
(The housing market is scaring the shit out of me, I have never looked before, but after a few initial searches, what the actual fuck!!! I know it was bad, but I am using calculators and I am finding buying a house to be a miserable daunting experience that takes all of our extra money...This is crap guys :( )  
  
(Oh and one more note, we actually don't know exactly how long we will be able to live in our current rental house. Our landlords could decide to sell at any moment, and that would totally be their right to do. (Of course they would give us plenty of time to find other arrangements, they really are great people), but I certainly don't expect this situation to last forever. But as of now, there is no sign of them selling, and I am finally in a place where I will actually be able to SAVE money, instead of paying off debt., so it feels wrong somehow to just leave here and pick up a giant mortgage bill...)  
  
Sorry if I just word vomited at y'all PF! I don't know if that all makes sense but maybe I just need someone to tell me, like ""duh girl, you need to do this!...""  
  
(I am also the most indecisive, commitment fearing person ever. This is the first person who has learned this about me, moved slow, and I can't tell you how much that has made a difference. Instead of wanting to run for the hills, I actually want a life with this fella.)",[2200.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17cpbga/stay_in_rental_house_we_pay_peanuts_for_or_make/
t5_2qstm,I did not understand the financial consequences of becoming an expat. Could use your advice.,"I did not understand the financial consequences of becoming an expat. Could use your advice.  Hey PF, I could really use some advice. I’ve already done some research but I’m not finding helpful information. Also, I know that there is an r/expatfinance but it’s a very small community so I figured I’d have better luck here. 

I am a 26yo US citizen that moved to the Netherlands in February for work. I consider myself an expat because I intend to move back to the States, but there is no plan for when that will be. It could be three years or ten or more; I’m kind of winging it. I had spoken to some other US expats about how they invest and manage finances before I made the move, but I’m learning that it’s much more complex than I had understood it to be.

Looking at the PF [Prime Directive chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png), I’m at Step 4. I have an emergency fund and by living frugally I’ve been able to pay off all my debts. Now, I’ve got a steady stream of cash and I want to start investing it. When I moved, my original plan was to max out my 401k, then a personal IRA and then get into Mutual Funds. 

Well. There are the problems with that plan.

**The problems:** 

* **I no longer qualify for IRA contributions**. [Apparently](https://thunfinancial.com/iras-roth-iras-and-the-conversion-decision-for-americans-living-abroad/), expats can only make IRA contributions on income that is above the amount excluded by the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the Foreign Housing Exclusion (FHE). Basically, the limit is $100,000, so if I made $110,000 a year, I could use $10,000 to contribute to an IRA. But I don’t make more than 100k, so an IRA is not an option.
* **I can no longer contribute to the 401k I had in the states**. When I called the bank about it, they said that neither I nor my employer can pay into this account, and unless I want to pay a penalty I also can’t move the funds anywhere. 401ks can only be funded by US earned income, and it can only be rolled over (such as into an IRA) if I switch employers. I transferred offices within my company to move abroad, so: same employer, but no US earned or taxed income. The money that is there will grow and shrink with the market, but otherwise it’s just going to sit there. 
* **I am not permitted to invest in mutual funds.** For example, from [this](https://www.offshorelivingletter.com/fatca-regulations-non-resident-americans-cant-invest-u-s-mutual-funds/) article: “Fidelity, Schwab, and other brokerage houses announced that they will no longer allow U.S. persons living outside the United States to invest in U.S. mutual funds.”  
 This one frustrates me the most. From all the research I’ve done, mutual funds seem to be the right kind of investment vehicle for me, and I actually feel like I understand them as opposed to ETFs or other choices. Every US expat I spoke to before moving said that they put their money into mutual funds, and even the article linked above says to just **do it anyway** by using a US address on all the paperwork. I’ve seen many resources online that recommend the same. But…wouldn’t that be considered fraud?
* **Realistically, I can’t invest in foreign mutual funds.** Apparently most non-US financial institutions won’t sell mutual funds to a US citizen because of the hassle of doing the reporting and the consequences of getting it wrong. I’ve heard that it’s possible but not worth it. When I set up a bank account in the Netherlands, their direct advice was that if I intend to move back to the States, don’t invest abroad. 
* **I don’t want to rely on my Netherlands retirement pension.** My employer is required by Dutch law to set up a pension for me, but my understanding is that the system here ramps up the contributions over time and really only starts earning me money after I’ve been in the Dutch workforce or a while (like 10-20 years). I can’t say with confidence that I’ll be here that long, and I can’t manage how much is put in while I am here. For that and other reasons, I want to keep the pension as my retirement Plan B instead of Plan A. 

So. Reddit. Please help. I’m at a loss here, I don’t know what options are left to me. I have a brokerage account with Charles Schwab (with a very small amount invested in mutual funds from before moving) and their advice was to invest in ETFs. I’ve read up on ETFs, but to be honest I don’t feel like I understand them well enough yet to put my money there. What I liked about mutual funds is that they seem like a very low-maintenance approach to investing. Buy them, let them sit and grow, sell them 10+ years later when the time comes. That’s my comfort level with investing, at the moment. 

Other options I’ve seen are to create my own “mutual fund” by going out and buying individual stocks or to invest in property. Creating a “mutual fund"" seems way over my head and investment experience level. Also, I’ve considered property, but I’m hesitant given the uncertainty around how long I’m going to live in any one place (my company could always send me to another country in a year or something), and I’d need to save for a while for a down payment anyway. 

**In short, I would really appreciate any answers to these questions:**

* What options are left to me for long term investments?
* What would be the consequences of investing in US mutual funds anyway? I’m not asking you to advise me to do something I shouldn’t, but I want to feel fully informed about this issue. 

Some info on my finances:

After taxes, I bring home €3270 per month (with some variation. +/- €30)

On average, I have €700ish left over each month that I can invest/put to savings. I think it will get closer to €1000/month once I’m done with setting up costs, such as buying furniture.

Savings:

Discover bank - $20k in a high interest savings account for my emergency fund.

Netherlands bank - €3000 in savings so I have euros on hand for emergencies. At the end of each month, I take whatever I didn’t spend from that month’s paycheck and transfer it to dollars in my US accounts.

Debt:

None. I use credit cards to pay for most expenses to get airplane miles, but I pay it off every month. 

I think for someone in their 20s, I’m in a pretty stable financial situation. It’s been a mix of good habits and good luck to get here and I want to make the best of the situation I’m in to prepare for the future and some large costs I know I'm going to have eventually. The idea that I don’t know what to do now has been really stressing me out.   


**tl;dr** What can an investing noob do with their money when they can't invest in a 401k, IRA, mutual funds of any kind, or property?","[100000.0, 110000.0, 10000.0, 20.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8zl3my/i_did_not_understand_the_financial_consequences/
t5_2qstm,Bank is refusing to refund fraud VISA charges of $6300,"Bank is refusing to refund fraud VISA charges of $6300 Hi Everyone,

Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in but looking for advice. I'll preface by saying this is my parent's issue and it sounds like they've done everything to try to get the matter resolved. 

My parents found out roughly 3 weeks ago that their card had been charged at our local Best Buy in the amount of about $6300. They called Bank of America and reported the charge as fraudulent as soon as they noticed the charge the very next day. According to my dad, the person on the phone said there wasn't anything they could do to cancel the charge and that they would just ""let it see if it goes through"" and take it from there. In the meantime the card would get canceled and they would get sent a new card. Fast forward 2 weeks later the charge goes through and now Bank of America is saying it's my parents' responsibility to pay for the outstanding balance. 

My dad still has his card (it wasn't physically stolen) but BoA is saying the card was presented physically at the store and because the card is chipped and a signature was presented they are liable for all charges. 

They've already gone to the police and filed a report, they have also inspected the security security tapes at Best Buy which they said has revealed nothing (according to them the sun was shining into the camera so you couldn't see anything during the time the purchase was made). 

I'm not sure what more advice I can give them so looking to Reddit for any help or other advice I can offer them.

**Update:** Just woke up and wow this blew up way bigger than I thought it would. Thanks everyone who offered up advice. I need to go to work soon but some responses to some questions/comments since I don't think I can respond to every comment here one by one like I was last night.

**Credit Card or Debit Card?**

Credit card.

**Sounds like this was done by someone your parents knew**

I'm not saying it's not true but I believe it's highly unlikely. Mainly because they don't have too many friends but have also communicated to them this possibility.

**Why didn't anyone at BB check id on the purchase?** 

They asked the same thing and Best Buy simply said it's their policy to check ID and nothing more was said on the matter.

**How could it possibly be there was only one camera that suspiciously was blinded by sun?**

I told them that it's impossible that a big box store like BB would only have a single camera pointed at the registers that was conveniently blinded by the sun. They said they would try to pursue the matter further with the police; I told them even just walking around that BB and pointing out all of the security cameras in the store would be enough to make the case that there are cameras elsewhere and that the police need to go back. To clarify, my parents did not go to the BB themselves to get at the security footage; they filed a report with the police and they went and told them the sun in camera story. 

**This story sounds fishy and you're lying/you stole the card**

I won't deny the story sounds fishy but not sure what I have to gain in fabricating this story. I just wanted some advice from anyone who might know what other avenues they can pursue and never expected this thread to blow up the way it did (it only had 6 posts when I went to bed last night and honestly I thought that'd be the end of the feedback). As far as accusations that I stole the card, I live 400 miles away and haven't lived at home since high school.

I'll try to continue updating as this unfolds.

**Update 2**: Tried to reply to some of the comments but heading to work now. Will be back tonight to look through all of the advice here and provide updates.

**Update 3**: Just got home from work earlier and off the phone with my mom. Thank you so much for responses everyone! I actually forwarded my mom this thread earlier so she could comb through some of the advice in the comments while I was at work and she responded a bit below to one of the comments. She's going to keep leaning on the police to get at those security tapes from and inspect them from all angles and has filed a complaint online with the Consumer Bureau and has drafted a physical letter that she'll be sending to BoA. She's also contacted our local news outlet to see if they can help get things moving along and investigated properly. Will see what the outcome is and post updates in the near future. 

**Update 4**: Just saw I got a PM from someone who claims to work for BoA, going to get in touch with them a bit and see where that takes us.

I give a detailed report of my expenses & background! Somebody, please help me get out of this mess :( Hello first off, I want to say thank you guys for helping people like me who are struggling. I really appreciate it! I am really having trouble trying get this debt paid off. I am looking for someone who can help me come up with a solid plan to get all this debt paid down.

# Background:

I am going to be very honest with you guys about my situation, my background, and my finances. I haven't made the best choices with my money and credit but I have gotten alot better. When I started building credit I was in a really bad place in my life. I was living in bad household conditions and was using drugs regularly to numb myself from what I had to deal with. I am clean now! I grew up with a family of 10 and my mother passed away when I was very young and my sister passed away a few years ago. My dad had to raise 10 of us as a single dad with bad credit & not the best income. We really struggled growing up. When I was 18 years old I hadn't been to the dentist since I was like 10 years old. My teeth were really bad and the only way I could afford the dental bills was with credit so I racked up ALOT of debt getting my health figured out. My first two cars went to shit in a matter of weeks. I lost alot of money on that. I also made some bad investments. I had a gambling & drug problem for awhile but I am clean now and don't gamble nor do I have any desire to. Another bad habit is impulse buying. I sometimes buy unnecessary crap off Amazon and regret it later. I really want to get out of this miss. I will commit to a solid plan.

I am going to do my very best to give you as much info I can so you can see the full financial picture. I am 26 years old and living with my two brothers at the moment and splitting the bills three ways. We share an apartment and plan on buying a house soon.

# Current Employment Situation & Goals

I only work one job 40 hours a week. Sometimes I get overtime but not so much anymore. I have been looking into real estate investing for a few years as a way to make passive income and have multiple sources of income but I feel I need to get my debt paid off first. I also am considering applying for a management position at my work which pays over 100k a year. Only thing stopping me is I didn't finish high school due to family issues and not sure if they would ask for my diploma if I did apply. I told them I did graduate when I applied 5 years ago. I have been with this company for almost 6 years. Should I risk applying for management position? They want me to apply and I am more then qualified to do the job as I have a ton of experience there and am in a leadership role currently. Should I try to get my hs diploma online through pennfoster or just get my GED? Please advice me as I don't know what to do.

t5_2qstm,My income feels like it should go further than it does,"My income feels like it should go further than it does **Edit**
Thank you so much everyone for the honest advice, it is appreciated. I actually spent about 90% of the day really digging into things. I’ve known there was an issue for a while but this really made me think about it in great detail. 

1. As I stated before, the biggest thing that happened this year was car & house repairs and maintenance at about $17,000. This was to keep the car from outright having the wheels fall off and the engine explode, and for the house it included things that HAD to happen (septic repair/pump, plumbing issue) and some things that I in my mind THINK had to happen, but maybe were not as dire. For example I sealed the deck, which I did because I saw some issues arising and I wanted to catch it before it became a bigger problem. Before you ask I did this myself, I do 99% of the things on the house myself, including plumbing when it’s not a septic back up that is beyond my capabilities (I’m less savvy about cars). Last month alone I did the deck, fixed a spigot, power washed the house, fixed a couple of holes/divots in the driveway, added/fixed siding on the shed that had fallen off, and fixed some concrete holes that were developing on the outside of the house foundation. None of these were more than about $100 per project but they very much added up. Did I HAVE to do them? No. If I didn’t do them now would they cost me more money and headache later? Probably. Not really sure what the right answer is to this other than possibly burn the house down for the insurance money (only somewhat kidding).

2. Because of some of the big expenses that I was paying for month after month, I stopped earlier this year buying things in bulk from Costco, because I didn’t have the cash needed at the time to do so. Instead I’ve been buying things like pet food/litter (1 dog, 2 cats), the aforementioned and much ridiculed laundry detergent and toilet paper, and dry goods like coffee a little at a time from either Walmart or Food Lion. It doesn’t seem like a lot at the time, $40 here and there for things, but it really did add up, as many of you suggested. Overall, between 2022 and 2023 my expenses for things like this almost doubled per month, which is really telling because in 2022 the leech boyfriend and his two children lived here too, so obviously the bulk buying I was doing before really made a difference. 

3. My grocery budget for fresh foods and things of that nature is also about double what it was in 2022, for just one person versus two adults and two part-time kids. I am being 100% honest with you when I tell you I do not eat a lot or fancy, and I eat out usually around two weekends a month with friends for about $50/time. I think two things are happening here: 1) same as #2, I no longer buy in bulk but instead here and there, and I think it adds up more and 2) I really do think grocery costs are more. There’s actually multiple items I no longer buy because they are too expensive. I’m a pescatarian and used to always have some kind of fish or shrimp around for a meal twice a week or so and I don’t do that anymore, I only eat that when I’m traveling for work. I also no longer buy or have alcohol at home because I don’t want to spend the money on it. I think I need to revisit buying in bulk and being more thoughtful with food purchases beyond just trying to keep each shopping trip as cheap as I can. 

4. I mentioned this before but I spent about $4,000 on gifts and shipping said gifts to family/friends ($1k more than I initially noted yesterday, as I hadn’t factored in Christmas gifts to that yet, which I now did). I was completely shut off from everyone for years due to terrible boyfriend and I think I went a bit nuts with this one. I think next year everyone is going to get cards from me, easy change here. 

5. Discovered that my Bank of America banking has a whole budgetary feature that you can tag/track/make pie charts etc of expenses, which is what helped me understand some of the above. Very useful, but I’ll also look into YNAB - thank you to all who suggested this. 

6. Finally, to address some of the questions about my regular monthly expenses:
- StarLink is it for internet. No choices on plans or speeds or whatever, you either have it for $120/month or you don’t. I’ve tried six different internet options and they were all maxing out at speeds of 5mbps and I couldn’t work with it (and they were all more expensive anyways). Starlink is 100Mbps. I’ll subsist solely on lentils before I get rid of Starlink, it’s a godsend. 
- I’m going to shop around for other wireless carriers. Own both mine and my mom’s phone so I think this should be a good idea. 
- I got multiple quotes for car insurance and only one was slightly lower. Some were higher. It’s been this way since I got divorced, before I was married I paid $34/month insurance on the same car and it was significantly newer. I honestly do not know what’s up with that. Note I have been quoting with “the big companies” (Geico is what I have, quoted with Nationwide, Progressive, Farmers). I am hesitant to quote with the kind of “sketchy” outfits but am honestly considering it now. 
- I went ahead and bumped up my 401k contributions to 10% for now, see how that works out. I am aware I am sorely behind for retirement, I have always assumed I’ll just have to work until I’m dead, or by some amazing stroke of luck I’ll manage to keep the house from collapsing and I’ll sell it for a bundle and move in my retirement to a tropical island where a cabana boy in white shorts will bring me pina coladas all day. Who knows. 
- I am aware a roommate could solve a lot of my problems. It took me 2 years to get worthless leech boyfriend out of my house so I am very, very hesitant to let anyone back in, even as a roommate. I am considering it but I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not sure I am going to be able to go that route. 

I’m sure I missed plenty of questions and comments and I apologize for those that I didn’t address. I appreciate everyone’s feedback very much. Not completely sure what to do about the grocery budget, the house and car still to be honest, but I’m going to start 2024 for sure doing the following:
- Giving people hugs for gifts 
- Watching where every penny goes and tracking in an app of some kind 
- Saving up to buy in bulk 
- Changing my wireless carrier (if I can find a good option) 
- Figuring out what to do about my car insurance 

Probably missed something there but it’s a start. Thank you everyone!!

Original post 




I just want some honest feedback from everyone. I am finally in the $100k club and make about $105-$107k/year. I have thought for years as I have worked my way up the ladder that things would be financially easier when I get to this number but they are not. I am struggling majorly, to the point that I worry if I will honestly not be able to do this, but I don’t even know what the alternative would be. 

For reference:
I am single
I live in an area that is not the cheapest place in the US but not the worst either - according to Forbes it has the 20th highest cost of living in the country as of 2023
I DO own my own home. My mortgage is $1870/month.
I have no other debts - no car payment, no student loan debt, no credit card payments
I do put in 6% of my income to my 401k.
I got solar for my home, so although I have a $200/month loan cost for that, I have $0 in utilities every month, which I feel like is a good trade-off and why I do it (it saves me about $1600 averaged out over the year versus before I got the solar) 

My take-home, after taxes/401k/insurance is taken out is $2789 per pay period, or an average of $1395/week if averaged out and 26 pay periods accounted for (yes, I know some years there are 27). I usually get about $500/year on my tax return. My bills average out to $1400 per pay period or $700/week (mortgage, car insurance, solar/utilities, internet, cell phone). This is $695/week for “spending money” after regular bills, which sounds fine initially but after gas, food (even cheap food), and things like toilet paper and laundry detergent, I’m often looking at $20 leftover at the end of the month. One unexpected or large expense like a house or vehicle repair can take me months to pay off. 

I don’t shop for stuff. I own two pairs of jeans and keep patching them. I eat ramen a LOT. I have an older car that is barely hanging on and I am 100% confident I cannot afford to replace it, but live in constant fear of it having expensive repairs that I won’t be able to afford. The air conditioner in the car died a year ago and I can’t afford to replace it so, in the summer, I’m just hot. I often don’t do things with friends because I can’t afford to do them (go to dinner, etc). I used to be able to save money (I saved for my down payment 10 years ago or so) and now that never happens.

I see houses listed for $2500/rent or mortgage per month or see people buying $800k houses. People go on vacations and, unbelievably, have children. I don’t get it. How do people do this? Is everyone else making $400k and I’m getting screwed? Does everyone else just rack up thousands of dollars in debt and not care? I really, honestly want to know. I feel like life should be easier by now but it most assuredly is not. I feel like I should be able to go on a decent vacation or trip once a year and that is a completely laughable thing to even think about. Even if I sold my home and rented or bought elsewhere I highly doubt I’d find a lower monthly rent/mortgage cost than I have.

Here are all the red flags I experienced today with Surace-Smith, an agency for American Income Life:","I'm unemployed right now and got called by a recruiter for an interview. It sounded sketch but I figured it can't hurt to check it out just in case. Here are all the red flags I experienced today with Surace-Smith, an agency for American Income Life: Remember folks, unless you're some sort of high flyer, if the hiring process is more like a sales pitch to you than a trial to prove your value to the organization, it's probably not something you want to do.

Red flag 1: Yesterday I got an email and then a phone call about a job opportunity. Either I had clicked on an ""apply now"" thing on Indeed.com for a vague posting or they found my resume, but the short description about the job on the phone was that I'd be assisting members of labor unions, credit unions, and professional associations learn about their benefits. The ""interview"" was to be today. I figured this is probably nothing I'm interested in, but on the face of it so far, it seems like it could be legit.

Red flag 2: Form letter confirmation email sent immediately after phone call. It states ""Attire: Business Professional, Business Suit.""

Red flag 3: Arrive to location, find two people waiting outside the entrance to the suite inside the building for the same interview time.

Red flag 4: Wrong entrance (other entrance I had seen had different company name on it). We are escorted to another entrance where several others are in line to check in. A lady in pleather pants and gaudy heels is escorting folks to the back as they sign in.

Red flag 5 (I should really have left by now, right?): I am given a ""personality profile"" multiple choice question sheet to complete. I am also asked if I have something to write with, as though it is a deep and urgent concern.

Red flag 6: Upon completing check-in, I am ushered into a presentation room with maybe 40 total people in the audience. These, I realize, are my fellow ""applicants,"" but I really feel ""rube"" is a better description.

Red flag 7: Observing the other applicants, it's clear they are a broad mix of ages and backgrounds. Some are are clearly folks that can at least present themselves professionally, but others are clearly not able to do so, either because they lack the means or social mores. From their chit-chat with one another, it doesn't seem like many of them are the kind of people I have a lot in common with other than the need for employment.

Red flag 8:The presenters enter, four men and one woman. Man 1 has spiked, gelled hair buzzed on the sides, but it isn't artfully done. He is wearing a loudly patterned suit. Man 2 looks much better dressed and groomed, but has two rings on his right hand, including a pinkie ring with some large emblem on it. Man 3 is reasonably dressed, but Man 4 is wearing a shiny, patterned suit; a pique shirt that is monogrammed; ostentatious cuff links; and a shiny, chain bracelet. His hair is also spiked with gel and buzzed on the sides, though it's better done and fits his build better than with Man 1. Man 1 looked like someone who just didn't know any better, but on Man 4 it was straight up ""bruh."" Upon standing it becomes obvious that Man 4's suit is tailored to his body but still bunches at the shoulder oddly, indicating that he probably ordered it from a made-to-measure website rather than a bespoke clothier in person. Man 4 is also not wearing a tie. Upon removing his jacket while speaking, it is clear that Man 4's shirt is actually too small for his bulging biceps.

Red flag 9: I never get a chance to assess how the woman was dressed, because she never presented. If she did interact with the audience, it would have been after Man 4 finished speaking, but I left when it was clear he was winding down and was asking each person in the audience what they liked best about he presentation. So it looks like the entire leadership team of the org are somewhat douchey-looking guys.

Red flag 10: We are all asked (again) if we all have something to write with.

Red flag 11: Multiple company names are thrown around. I was recruited by the Hartwig Agency, but the job is for Surace-Smith, an agent of American Income Life Insurance Company, which is also owned by Torchmark Corporation (edit: all of this is legit, but it was not clear from the beginning who the employer actually was).

Red flag 12: The company's business model is to sell expensive insurance benefits to members of labor unions, credit unions, and professional associations. In their sample material the full annual premium of the benefits package they market is $1,600, but they pitch is as only costing $30 a week. There is lots of ""think about your family / children / these benefits can be passed on to them when you're gone"" talk, but it's stuff like funeral insurance, supplementary health insurance, and mortgage pay-off insurance. In other words, stuff that is expensive and should be taken care of with a simple term-life policy that's way, way cheaper for the consumer. In short: this business model is somewhat unethical.

Red flag 13: During the presentation the company's success is hyped up. A lot. Lots of talk about their growth and about their revenue and stock price. An impressive chart showing 1996 to now is shown. They talk about how Warren Buffet owns a lot of it. No mention is made about the plummet in value the company's stock price experienced in 2014, only about half of which is accounted for by a stock split, or of how growth has been significantly slower since then.

Red flag 14: A description of who they are looking for is given in the form of the ""Seven Cs."" We are urged to write down the Cs and to contemplate which is most important to us. Later, the five Ps are also brought up in terms of how to get clients to purchase their product.

Red flag 15: They claim to be rated in the best placed to work by a Cleveland newspaper. A search shows they are not, or at least not in the top 75 of the most current ranking.

Red flag 16: Man 3, the presenter on ""technology,"" extols the virtue of their system in which ""representatives"" (those hired) use laptops to show what is essentially an interactive video as the primary pitch to potential customers rather than have to make the pitch or explain anything themselves. Later is it implied we will need our personal laptops for this.

Red flag 17: Compensation is entirely commissions based, and it is further revealed that it's a pyramid scheme. After the first 3 months, representatives can train other reps and get a match on their commission. As you age into the company, these matches increase in size and become tiered. We're told that as the folks we once trained have trained other folks and they start making sales, we earn a match on that commission too.

Red flag 18: When they talk about the charities they support as a company, I only recognize one (FCA), and they all appear to be faith-based.

Red flag 19: Man 4 removes his jacket during his presentation, revealing a shirt that was too tight. He hands his jacket to the one woman, who hasn't spoken to us at all. She places it lightly on his chair back. Man 4 proceeds to sip on a large can of energy drink during his presentation.

Red flag 20, and perhaps the biggest: Man 4 encourages audience members to pay ~$250 for the various online training courses and license application fees to be legally able to perform this job in the state of Ohio with a credit card. He had strong recommendations for which online training site to use - to the point that I suspect the company owns that site. He makes it clear that ""this isn't for us, this is for the state. We don't pay for this because this is a licence that you keep and will put on your resume.""

Red flag 21: At the conclusion of Man 4's presentation (by which time Men 1-3 have left), he asks each audience member to say their name what they liked best about what we've all just heard. At this point I simply leave, uninterested and feeling dirty all over.

Red flag 22: As I exit the office, the lady at reception is very concerned about getting my name before I leave.

t5_2qstm,Teaching My Children about PF,"Teaching My Children about PF I just wanted to share what I consider a parenting success story.  My wife and I have been giving $20/week to our 11 and 8 year old every Saturday for some time now.  Not tied to chores or grades or anything, nor did we put restrictions on what they could buy.  Our goal is to teach them about managing their money and what it means to spend it.  For a long time, we rarely had to physically hand them paper money because as soon as payday rolled around, they'd want to buy something for one of their digital games.  Sometimes they'd even ask for an advance, which we refused.  Once you spend the money, it's gone.  They'd almost always spend their money on some skin or in-game currency on a game, get bored with that game, and then move onto the next one.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  

Recently, my 11 year old has been saving most of his money to buy a laptop.  The last time we sent him to the grocery store (we live 2 blocks away in a small town), he even bought his brother a treat because his brother had spent all his money for the week.  It has been so satisfying to see him create a financial goal and a plan to reach that goal instead of spending his money just because he has it.   It's cost us hundreds of dollars, but I feel it will save him thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by learning this lesson before he lives on his own.  We are fortunate enough to have the cash to give to the kids, so I understand this isn't something everyone has the luxury of doing.  I wasn't 100% sure how this would turn out, but I am glad we gave it a try.

Edit: Thanks the wonderful responses and advice. A common question has been if I’m worried about teaching them that they don’t have to work for their money, which I understand. We do require the children to do chores, but we don’t believe in tying their allowance to these chores for several reasons. The first being that we didn’t want to introduce another variable to this lesson. This is strictly about teaching financial management.  We also feel that basic chores aren’t something that deserve a financial reward, but rather a responsibility that comes with being a family.  We also feel strongly about volunteering in our small town, where many activities and events require community involvement in order to happen. I want the boys to learn that you can work without reward. Finally, we live in a small town in North Dakota.  There chores aren’t just basic tasks line sweeping or mowing. One of the things they help me with is shoveling snow when it’s -5. They also help my dad on the farm.  I’m definitely not worried about the boys struggling to learn the value of hard work even though we’re giving them money every week. They’ll get summer jobs just like I did when they’re old enough, and we’ll contribute to an IRA for them so they can learn that saving early pays off later. 

I really appreciate all the feedback. Definitely some great ideas to incorporate. Thank you so much!",[20.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l02m3d/teaching_my_children_about_pf/
t5_2qstm,How gaining control of my finances changed my whole life,"How gaining control of my finances changed my whole life Hi r/personalfinance. I posted something similar to this a while back and accidentally deleted it before it got much traction. I really wanted to share my story with you guys because my life has changed so much in less than five years. I never imagined that I could be financially stable and enjoy the freedom that comes with it. I had such a mental disconnect when it came to budgeting and spending. If I can get my head out of my ass, anyone can. (I'm in the US for reference)

Four years ago, I was a 27 year old woman with a decent career. I had graduated college a couple of years early at 19 and immediately found a job in my field. I'd been working for 8 years, steadily receiving an annual pay increase every year since I started. 

When my computer broke and I needed a new one, I headed to the store with stars in my eyes. At the time, the laptop that I wanted cost around $900. I had nowhere near that amount in my savings account, but surely I'd be able to finance it. I remember very clearly standing in front of a clean-cut kid ten years my junior, against a background of sleek, glowing screens as he told me that my application for financing had been denied and he was sorry, but there was nothing else that could be done. I had to face reality. I was broke. 

Even making $50,000 a year and with no student debt, I had somehow gotten myself in financial dire straits. That year, I moved in with roommates to try to save money and even when I cut my rent in half, my situation did not improve what-so-ever. I had several very high interest (25%) credit cards totaling about $10k and I owed around $3k on my car which I was paying 14% interest on. I was living paycheck to paycheck, I had no money in the bank and my credit was abysmal. 

I began to think that some people just aren’t ""good with money” and that was it for me. Well really, to be honest, I just tried not to think about it at all. If I had money in the bank, I spent it. Instead of working to fix that situation, I worked harder at making money. I got a second job and put in more hours. I was working myself to the bone and I was burning out before turning 30. 

It was around that time that I met my future husband, J. He could see how tired I was with my job and encouraged me to quit and pursue something that I really wanted. I explained that, in my financial situation, there was no POSSIBLE way that I could afford to make any less money. He started to inquire about my finances and, of course, was surprised to see what a mess I was in. However, being someone who was financially savvy, he assured me that my debt was not insurmountable and vowed to start me on a path to financial stability. 

Now, a couple of years later, I work in a different field doing something that I really love. I make a little less money, but I work a lot less and I am happy to say that the stresses of my old life are a distant memory. Last year, I actually took a hiatus from work to travel abroad. Even on a reduced income, I have five figures in my bank account, a new car and a credit score well above 700. Getting control of my finances changed my life significantly because it allowed me the freedom to live how I want to without the constant pressure of working to pay my bills. 

I am certainly not rich, nor am I a financial guru, but I would like to share a couple of things that I have learned throughout the course of this journey. 

First, if you want to change, you can’t ignore your situation. I was the queen of ignoring. If I thought my bank account balance was getting low, I wouldn’t look at it. If I missed a credit card payment, I didn’t want to see the late fee. I would forget about it. I didn’t look at my credit report because I didn’t want to see all of that red. And in the beginning, when J was trying to set me straight, it was hard. There were a lot of fights because I refused to look the issue in the face. I’d do literally anything else before I would sit down and call my credit card company. Admitting that I had been stupid with my money and committing to actively change was very difficult for me, but obviously extremely necessary. 

Second, consolidate and stay organized. One reason things got so bad in the first place was that, in my early twenties, I couldn’t keep up with my credit cards. I couldn’t remember which ones I had paid or when the promotional rates expired and I had no method for keeping track of bills. Once I missed a payment and the interest shot up to 25%, I felt helpless and didn’t want to look at the statements anymore. The very first thing that J and I did was consolidate my debt so that it was easier to manage. We went to a local credit union and took out a consolidation loan using my car as collateral.  Credit Unions are a good place to start because they are small and locally owned. You can sit down face to face with someone and talk to them about your situation and I found that they were willing to help. They gave me a loan that paid off all of my credit card debt, so now I only had to pay them each month instead of making payments on four different cards. The interest rate was high, but for the first time, all of my debt was in one place. I set my payment to auto-pay and put it on the back burner. 

Third, pay attention to those offers in the mail. After I had consolidated my credit card debt and had been making regular payments for about 6-8 months, my credit score started to improve and I began receiving credit card offers in the mail. Eventually, I was getting offers for a 0% balance transfer. I picked a card with no annual fee, a low transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. (BTW, I couldn't pay off my credit union loan with a credit card. I needed a card that would give me cash that I could use to pay the credit union. This is a thing I didn't even know existed, so examine all of your options) By this time, I had a spreadsheet with all of my bill pay and credit card information so I made sure to make a note of when my promotional rate expired. I transferred all of my high-interest debt to a 0% credit card and then, a year later, just before that rate expired, I moved it to a new card at 0%, so that I had several years to pay of the balance without paying any interest. 

Finally, and for me, this was most important, pay attention to your spending. I used to HATE looking at my bank statement - mostly because I knew I would feel bad or guilty about the low (sometimes negative) balance. Once my situation became more stable and I started saving money, the opposite happened. I felt proud and I wanted to look at my account and see a growing savings. In turn, this made me more frugal and I started to become very aware of how much money I was really throwing away. 

Clothes were my weakness. My closet was overflowing with cheap “retail therapy” items. Now, rather than buy cheap clothes every time I go to the store, I allow myself to buy one luxury clothing item from a high end store a couple of times a year. I've changed a lot of my habits and reduced spending in almost every area that I can. We also live very frugally, in general. We set a budget every month and stick to it religiously. I could go on for another three pages just about budgeting but that will have to be a post for another day. Most of the furniture in our house was purchased second-hand and we rarely go out to eat or make large purchases, since we prefer to spend our money on travel. 

I never thought I'd be a financially stable person. I never imagined that I would enjoy budgeting or checking my bank account balance but once I discovered how much freedom I could have by making small, meaningful changes, I feel like the whole world has opened up to me. I hope I can inspire someone else to do what I dreaded for so long. It is possible to fix things even when you've lived with bad habits for a long time. 



Edit: Wow. Thank you for all of the awesome responses. It seems like so many people have been in this same spot and have good things to share. I wanted to post an update because a lot of people have asked the same questions about specifically what to do to cut spending. Maybe this sounds cheesy, but it's an honest answer. My entire approach to life has changed. Changing my spending habits has been a fight against my own values. Initially, it feels depressing to work hard and still drive a beat up car, wear the same clothes more frequently than you want or stay in six nights a week when your friends are going out. But when you restrict yourself, slowly, the things you find important start to change. You begin to discover that having stability is more fulfilling than having THINGS. When you can learn to find great joy in a free walk through the park,teaching yourself a new skill or how to cook a new dish from scratch, you start to feel that spending money on things is a distraction from many interesting facets of life. So my advice in that regard is this - look at your bank statement and HONESTLY examine every item that is not a bill payment. Last month on my statement, I only had four charges that were not bills and they were each less than ten dollars. Find free ways to spend your time that you find engaging and interesting and take time to truly examine and appreciate what life has to offer beyond consumption.

What advice do you have?","33 years old, paying over 1/4 of my income just in interest on old debts and can't find a better paying job. Is my plan a good one? What advice do you have? Update: 2 weeks later, for folks reading this who are in similar situations

1. I contacted my credit cards and humbly told them I'm considering bankruptcy, and all of them agreed to lower my interest rates for six months. By then, my current consolidation loan will be paid off and I'm likely to qualify for a new one.

2. I have used many budget apps in my life - Mint, goodbudget, several others - But none have changed my relationship with money the way YNAB has. It was recommended to me here, and now I'm recommending it to anyone who reads this. The peace of mind is wonderful, especially for a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle. After two weeks of the trial I've decided it's definitely worth a yearly subscription fee, even though I'm not a subscription person and clearly money is tight for me. ;)

3. I contacted free legal aid in my county, and I'm in the process of setting up an appointment to discuss whether or not bankruptcy would be right for me.

4. I contacted several local agencies I'm interested in working with - including my local city government - to sign up for job notification lists that weren't readily visible on their websites, because they use a mix of in-house and third party hiring sites. Who knew!

Good luck, everyone!!!!

Edit #3: I'm so moved by the continued support, even private messages I'm receiving from all of you kind people with great advice and encouragement. I'm in tears with gratitude. It may take me a few days, but I'll get back to all of you. Thank you so, so, so much for humanizing me and helping me see hope.

---

I make a little over $15 an hour as a Visual Merchandiser at IKEA. My raise is only 3% a year, and there's no promotion I'm interested in. (See edit) I've kept an eye out for a better paying job, man I don't see one.

I have: a debt consolidation loan through BestEgg, 18k in high interest credit card debt over 2 different cards, and only 4k remaining in student debt.

I have tried and failed to qualify for a second debt consolidation loan to stop bleeding out from interest. Last week I successfully applied for a 0% interest balance transfer card. It only accepts $750 in balance transfers, and it's interest free for 15 months. A drop in the bucket and I didn't want another card, but I'm struggling so much with this interest I had to try.

My credit score is 680. I have never been late on a single payment. I've been struggling with this debt for years since leaving a financially/emotionally abusive husband, and I'm exhausted. Because I live paycheck to paycheck, I sometimes feel I have no choice but to use the high interest card for emergencies (plane tickets to see sick relatives, for example). I have *nothing* in savings. Saving feels impossible and has for years. Sometimes I'm late on my rent. I don't own a car or a computer, but bankruptcy still feels like a bad idea.

In September, my debt consolidation loan will be paid off. My current plan is to apply for another debt consolidation loan at that time with the hope that it will lower my interest charges and whittle down my debt more.

I live a simple life and I don't need to feel wealthy. I'm frightened of retirement, and frightened to have no savings.

I am so open to advice. Lordy. 

**Edit:** Thank you so much for all of the good advice! I feel I have a clearer sense of direction now. 

My parents live across the country and both are in poor health - sick is a classy way to say possibly dying, so for my life priorities that does indeed qualify as an emergency. And no, I'm not going to take a management job that would make me miserable every day for the sake of paying off my debts more quickly. I see the burnout rate and I'm not interested. It is already a balancing act to keep my body healthy enough to earn income, let alone adding that level of stress for a few bucks an hour.

But I appreciate the guidance about different approaches to managing debt. You've been very helpful, thank you so much.

**Edit again:** I was trying to avoid this type of share, but - I have several chronic health problems that make taking a second job or adding to my stress more of a risk to my earning potential than it's worth. 

I understand all of you who are reading my story and calling me lazy or spoiled, or unwilling to leave my comfort zone. I already have FMLA coverage for days when my body won't let me get out of bed, and although I can't afford to use them I often have no choice. I don't know how else to say it - my body creates very real limitations for me. Yes, that gives me discouraged emotional reactions about my livelihood.

I've used a friend's computer to look for opportunities to work from home, and I can't find anything that justifies the debt of buying a computer. 

I was raised an only child on a farm, adopted by older parents who didn't have much. I have worked since I was 16 years old. In college, I worked three jobs in addition to attending classes full time. I always had savings before I got married. My clothes are all from thrift stores. I live in a shared space situation that costs me only $450/mo, incredible for Philadelphia. I eat red lentils, roasted vegetables, and rotisserie chicken. People at work comment about how I always bring my lunch and it's always the same, lol

There is not a promotion merrily dangling in front of my face that I am too good for. To clarify, part of why I am not interested is because I am not qualified. My current payband is the same as any management position I could compete for within the company. IKEA has made drastic paycuts.

No, I'm not scrolling through Indeed with Princess Face saying no to jobs that ""aren't good enough"" for me. I literally can't see a career path I feel qualified for where I can make more.  I have been a janitor, a server, a tick farmer, a graveyard shift shelf stocker. I am not too good for things, I never have been.

Someone mentioned working in insurance - I'll look into it. I never see posts for that type of job online, I'm not sure where exactly I should look.

I hear a lot of people saying I should file for bankruptcy. I'll look for a lawyer I can speak with. 

I'm also picking up what you're putting down w/r/t being needlessly discouraged by HR's pie-in-the-sky job qualifications. I'll try to bear this in mind.","[15.0, 750.0, 450.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ak7emz/33_years_old_paying_over_14_of_my_income_just_in/

I applied for the CalFHA dream for all loan which grants the lender 20% of the price of the home for the down payment up to $150k. I am currently 23 and working as a software engineer in San Diego. Trying to gauge my price range of condos/homes I can buy. My budget would be around 600k so that the monthly payment doesn’t exceed 30% of my monthly income. I understand the implications of the loan and that I’ll have to pay it back plus 20% of the houses appreciation value when I sell it.

There are a couple things to consider about my life situation. 

I am currently dating someone long distance and would love to move out there with him if I can get a fully remote job that pays California wages. He lives in the Midwest so my current salary is much better than if I got one out there. 
My plan if I get a house is to live in it a couple of years and perhaps rent out the available rooms (if I get any), then once I fully move out, then I rent out the entire apartment. I have my parents in LA who said they would be willing to tend to it if need be if I rent it out.
I understand HOAs may not allow renting out rooms or the property which is why I’m going to try to find some sort of house.

This is obviously not a fool proof plan. Anything can happen and the worst of the worst could happen. But at my age, I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity to buy a home until much later in the future once I fully settle down.

I’d buying a home right now the best option for me? I haven’t been approved for the loan yet since they haven’t drawn the raffle. But I’m just going through the initial thought process and trying to figure out if I should even follow through on it.",[150.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1cfpzj6/should_i_buy_a_house_right_now_at_23/
t5_2qstm,Growing up poor and reflecting back on it,"Growing up poor and reflecting back on it After going on a major shopping spree today I felt really guilty for splurging on myself. 

I grew up the oldest of 6 kids. Mom and dad were refugees who never made more than $14/hr. We were never hungry but we went without and I didn't realize how poor we were until later on in life. To me, that's just the way it was. I never wanted things, asked for gifts or even dreamt about designer clothing or extravagant stuff bc it just wasn't part of our life. I had never eaten at an Applebee's until senior year in high school.

I remember one year in fourth grade my elementary school had a program called ""Food for Thought"". You would attend an hour of after school session where you'd do extra readings and assignments. For each hour you attended, you'd get a credit that would go towards a large paper bag of food. After a week or two (I can't remember), I went home with a large paper bag of food (right around the holidays) filled with cereals, dry snacks and oatmeal. I was so proud of myself for being able to contribute to my household. I still remember the look on my mom's face as she opened the bag. I could tell she was so happy and it was in that moment that I realized I could provide for my family using my brains. I could come home with a bag of food every week just for an extra hour after school? Sign me up! I went back to school the next day and told all my friends. And you know how that went - they made fun of me and called me a beggar for accepting free food. Mind you, most of them were just as poor as my family. I was made to feel so ashamed I never went back to this after school program. It was also then that I made the decision to never accept handouts no matter how poor or needing I was. 

Flash forward to my high school years. I was so happy when I turned 15 bc it meant I could start working. I would walk to numerous job interviews in my cheap blazer and dress in the summer time for a chance to earn my own money. I never asked my parents to take me because they were always working or too tired from working. At one point in high school I managed to juggle a full load with AP classes and two part time jobs. Luckily it was a small town and both of my bosses knew each other and were very accommodating about my work schedule and did all they could to make it work. My junior year in high school, my mom put up a Christmas tree (we only did it every so years) but we didn't have any presents to put underneath. Us kids were just so excited to have a tree up we didn't even care that there weren't presents. One day, our better off cousins came over and asked where the presents were. My mom must have felt embarrassed so that night she suggested that we wrap up empty boxes to put under the tree. I was even more embarrassed to do this but it made my mom feel better so I went along with it. Come Christmas morning, it was just another day and we woke up and went about our way. Christmas was never a special day- my mom had long stopped accepting gifts from charities once my brothers and I grew up. So as we got older, Christmas slowly faded and that's just the way it was. 

Right after high school, I got married and started working full time. It was the first time in my life that I ever had that much money to myself. It wasn't much, but it was mine. The first thing I did that year was spoil my brothers. Come Christmas time I bought them each a shirt and wrapped them as nicely as I could. I would bring the presents over two weeks before Christmas and my gifts would be the only ones under the tree. They were so excited about having gifts and couldn't wait to open them. Christmas mornings during those years was one of the happiest moments in my life. The joy of watching my kid brothers open their present  (usually a $20 t shirt) made me beam with pride and almost want to cry. We never had a proper Christmas growing up so I made sure that going forward we would. They were younger than me and didn't start working until later so I never got gifts in those years. I never really did get gifts as a child and even to this day it makes me uncomfortable when people spend money on me, even my better off friends. This is something I am still trying to work on and be more comfortable with. 

Anyway...today my 3 out of 5 brothers are doing well financially and I have a good paying job that I got right out of college. We don't worry about not having presents or going without. In fact, sometimes I feel like we all don't respect our money and as soon as it comes in, we splurge and the money is gone. It is something I am conscious of and working to fix. I recently heard the phrase ""poor person mentality"" and that fits me to a tee. I never knew I behaved in that way and I understand that if I ever want to get out of this poor cycle I need to change my mentality on money. I'm not poor anymore but I still feel like I am bc I'm not making good money decisions. 

Reading this subreddit has helped me enormously and I am just passing by to share my story.



UPDATE: (In response to your questions)

My parents are doing better today. They still don't make more than $14/hr each but they also don't have to support 6 young children. They own their own home, cars are paid off and they take the occasional vacations to go visit family. They live within their means and are generous. My mom helped found a community service group and is very active and involved with it. She's a great role model for my siblings and I. She's never had much, but she was willing to give you everything. My dad is retiring in five years and he's found his own hobbies to keep him occupied now that the kids are grown. He's a quiet man and never says much except for the occasional motivational talk with us. My parents did their best with us. 

Like I said above, we were never hungry growing up. They fed us first above all else and we cut back in other areas. I never knew how poor we were until later in life. It was just the way we grew up- that's how life had always been and it was all we ever knew. We each got one pair of shoes every year for back to school and it had to last the ENTIRE year. As a kid, I never knew that other kids got more than one pair of shoes and I never noticed what other kids had. I had a happy childhood. My family was very loving and we had a large extended family. When everyone else around you is in your boat, you don't know any different. How could I, as a child, dream of owning a Chanel purse if I had never seen one? 

The dream wasn't to own fancy cars or expensive purses or go on exotic vacations. The dream was to grow up and get a good job so mom and dad wouldn’t have to worry so much about us.

So, we didn't have as much as other kids but we did have a lot of love, encouragement and hope.

Thanks everyone for all your kind messages and words of support. I'm frankly overwhelmed by the number of people who have commented and shared their story and those who have sent me private messages about their struggles.

I wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a low-mid income.

**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**

**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)

**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles

**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)

**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April

**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)

**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal

**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)

**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)

**Avg CC APR:** 22%

**Credit Score:** 630

**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)

**Phone:** $105

**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**

**TV (Saved $130/month)**

I dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.

**Phone (saved $50/month)**

The first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.

**Insurance (saved $50/month)**

While I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.


**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**

**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**

I spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was not necessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.

Also, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

**Excel – Short Term Predictions**

I created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.
This would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.

**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**

I needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.

Balance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200 22.90%

Balance, APR - $3,586 19.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)

**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**

First thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.

**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**

Since my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.

**Create a Budget**

I used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.
This would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.


**Step 3 – ACTION**

**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**

Even though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, and made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.

**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**

As the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to ""catch up"" on payments.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv

Knowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.
Using YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out to the tune of $300 a month.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to spend this much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. 

If I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.


**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**

**The Beginning**

The first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.

**The Middle**

My next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.

**The End**

By November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.


**Step 5 – The Aftermath**

2015 Chart: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

At the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.

**FINALE**

In short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.

Throughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.

I hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and ""funner""…than you think.

**EDIT**

Couple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.

Secondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me ""oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks""......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.

Thirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.

**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**

People seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.

**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).

Had I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.

**EDIT - Excel Tracking Example**

http://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png

**Excel File Dropbox Link**

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bv38oxylouziuap/Account%20Balance%20Forecast%20File.xlsx?dl=0

This is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.

I'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.

As it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.

**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.

Again, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.","[10.0, 55.0, 10.0, 55.0, 1000.0, 55000.0, 1480.0, 775.0, 1550.0, 3.15, 3.85, 12400.0, 10000.0, 455.0, 250.0, 205.0, 105.0, 130.0, 150.0, 150.0, 18.0, 40.0, 50.0, 105.0, 54.0, 50.0, 205.0, 60.0, 154.0, 65.0, 65.0, 20.0, 2000.0, 2200.0, 3586.0, 2200.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 175.0, 800.0, 450.0, 1000.0, 20.0, 300.0, 1000.0, 10000.0, 0.0, 105.0, 54.0, 150.0, 18.0, 205.0, 154.0, 12400.0, 10000.0, 22900.0, 0.0, 450.0, 10000.0, 55000.0, 10000.0, 1480.0, 38480.0, 55000.0, 1480.0, 2960.0, 200.0, 500.0, 20.0, 35520.0, 38480.0, 5.0, 3500.0, 193.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4100ky/how_i_paid_off_10k_in_cc_debt_in_one_year_55k_no/

How to shop for a used car.

With a few exceptions – it really doesn’t matter what car you buy. There is no secret list of good or bad used cars, because any car could be a good car FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. So if a model is unreliable – it will have a worse reputation, which will lower the going rate. If you want a more reliable car – you will have to pay more, and even then there is no guarantee that your specific car will be trouble-free. Even behind the most reliable brand dealership there is a service department, and they do stay busy. While most people go for the same brands and models that have good reputation – it might make sense to go for the cars that are not recommend by any guides, because you might get much more value for your money.

More expensive (luxury and performance) brands and models will be more prone to problems, and they will cost more to fix, but they provide a better driving experience, safety and image, so you do get something for your money. If you don’t care for anything other than basic transportation – go for the cheap brands and models.

Buy privately or from a dealer? A franchise dealer or a used car lot? A private seller is a gamble. It could be a nice car that the owner is trying to maximize the value by selling it themselves instead of trading it at the dealer. Or it could be a nightmare car that they are trying to get rid of because it might fall apart at the next light.

So your best bet will be a franchise dealer that specializes in the brand you are buying, preferably Certified Pre-Owned, if it’s an option. CPO programs vary by brand, and they are not a 100% guarantee, but they should give you some assurance together with an extension of warranty. A dealer provides you a better assurance that you are not buying a problematic car. A dealer is required to make sure a car is safe, and a dealer has a reputation to maintain. If a dealer has a car with issues – he can easily dump it through an auction, and it will become someone else’s problem.

Next best thing is a franchise dealer that has an off-brand car, which was most likely traded in. The dealer was probably able to take it in trade for an amount low enough for them to recondition the car and sell it for some profit. Again, the dealer will be unlikely to go through the problem with a bad car that can come back to haunt them with issues.

Then there is the used car lot. Your risk is higher, those lots go out of business all the time, so you have very little recourse, but you will be paying less. Remember those cars that reputable dealers don’t want to deal with and send to an auction? Used car lots buy out these cars, patch them up, and sell them for as much as they can. Your last options is a private seller. A private seller is a gamble. It could be a nice car that the owner is trying to maximize the value by selling it themselves instead of trading it at the dealer. Or it could be a nightmare car that they are trying to get rid of because it might fall apart at the next light.

Pre-purchase inspection: it is a common advice to have any used car pre-inspected by an independent mechanic. Overall it is a good idea, with a few exceptions and footnotes:

If the car is still in warranty or is certified – inspection is an overkill, and the only thing you can get out of it is find out whether the car has been in an accident. If a used car in warranty has any major mechanical issues – it will be fixed under warranty. Don’t be surprised of a dealer refuses to let you inspect a car like that.

Some dealers don’t allow pre-inspections at all. They might not want to take the car off the lot for half a day for you to decide not to buy it or to come back with unreasonable offers. In the meantime – there could be a serious buyer with cash in hand on the lot.

Now, what can an inspection tell you, and how you should take it? The mechanic doing the inspection might have an agenda that is different from yours – he might want to justify his pay by pointing out too many problems. He might hope for you to still buy it and to bring it to him for more work. Then how can you tell what issues are normal and are to be expected in a used car? You can take any car off the road, run it through an inspection, and the mechanic will recommend on average $1,500 in repairs, which you can ignore and still drive the car for a few good years. Bottom line – again, used car is a risk, and you have to decide what is the right balance of risk, and the price you are willing to pay.

Private purchase: unless you have cash in hand – it will be difficult to put a purchase with financing. You CAN get a loan on a privately bought car, but it requires some work. You have to get a general approval, then you will have to get the actual loan for the actual car, and the bank will decide the amount based on the book value of the car, you will have to coordinate this with the seller and the bank, and until the seller gets paid – he can back out of it at any time, and you are back to the start.

Then there is another risk of dealing with a stranger and large amount of money. Don’t expect the seller to accept anything other than cash or a cashiers check. Meet in a public, well lit place, like a bank. Before you make the purchase – refer to your state DMV website for exact instructions on what paperwork is required to transfer the ownership and to register the car. Does it have to be smogged? Do you have to have a clear title? How can you verify that the car is paid off? Do you have to pay sales tax? If you are buying out of state – you will have to check both states to make sure you are in compliance. Sounds scary? It is. This is why dealers charge more, and now we will talk about buying a car from a dealer.

Once you decide on the model and brand – browse online listings. You have no business going to a dealer without having an idea of what you want to buy. Right now my favorite source is Autotrader – they provide a lot of tools that let you narrow your search down, and 99% of dealers list their inventory there.

Make sure that you are looking at cars that are within your budget, and not hope to negotiate a lower price before you even look at the car. If you can’t afford the asking price – you can’t afford it.

Now, the biggest issue that brings the most questions: the price. One thing you are to realize is that the market has changed a lot in the last few years, and if you haven’t bought a car in a while – it will be a different experience, and the good news is that it is easier and much less stressful that it used to be.

Here is how it used to be before the Internet: while there were classified listings in newspapers, most people shopped by visiting dealers, because there were no tools that would let you cross-shop and compare live inventory between different dealers. It was easier to go to a dealer lot, browse available cars, pick one, and hope to negotiate a deal. You could use a guide like Kelley Blue Book to gage whether the price was good or not, but in the end – you had to make a decision to buy there or to move to the next dealer, and if other dealers would not work out – by the time you got back the car could be sold. It takes a lot of time, and used car shoppers don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Here is what is happening now: since you can go online, narrow down available inventory by age, mileage, distance and even options – you see right away what is the going rate, and who offers the lower price. Dealers started to realize that if their asking price is higher than average – phones don’t ring, and cars don’t sell. When before they could hope to get people in and lower the price – now no one even comes in, because trying to negotiate thousands off a price against a professional salesman is just as fun as having your teeth pulled. First they learned to check the market before pricing out a car and to keep adjusting pricing of unsold cars to match the market rate. Next evolution was introduction of software services that do that for dealers. They use it when they take cars in trade or buy them at auctions, when they price cars, when they adjust prices to move aged inventory. The data is out there, all the software does is put it together. Let’s say the dealer has to take a car in trade. He punches the details of the car in the system: year, model, mileage, options. The system pull available matching inventory listed within 200 miles, calculates average and median price, calculates back how much the dealer has to pay for the car so that after reconditioning and assumed profit – they can price it below market average. Also the system will check auction history, and it will show how much similar cars sold at dealer auctions in the last weeks, so the dealer can see how much they car hope to get at an auction or buy similar cars.

What does this means to you as a shopper:

Profit margins are lower, and there is much less room for negotiation. Dealers simply can’t afford pricing cars high, hoping that someone will just bump into it and pay the price.

Dealers adjust pricing all the time, so if a car sat on a lot for a long time – it doesn’t matter much, as long as it is priced competitively. If you found the lowest priced car – others will find it too, and dealers don’t need to discount it any lower.

Once you found one or a few potential cars that match your requirements and price – you are ready to contact the dealer. It would be nice to be able to continue shopping and negotiating from your couch, get the best price, have the dealer tell you everything about the car and hold it until you will make up your mind and find time to go and buy it – but in reality things are a bit more complicated. Dealers have no interest in giving you more information than what they have to in order to get you in the door. Most dealers will post photos, videos, car history reports, but in the end you will have to do your due diligence in person – check out the car and drive it. If the dealer priced the car right – he doesn’t have to commit to a lower price over the phone or email, because it is obvious that you are already interested, and they definitely have no interest in taking the car off the market on the off chance that you will actually show up, agree to the car and buy it.

So when you contact the dealer – your goal is to make sure that the car is actually still there, that it is ready and not still going through service or body work, to confirm options that are important to you, and to make a solid appointment. You want to make sure that you are meeting with a specific sales person, and not just a generic appointment set by a call center agent, that you know who you are meeting, exact time, and that the car will be actually there. Statistically about half of appointments show up, so dealers don’t put a lot of faith in them, and they might not even bother checking that the car and the sales person is ready and available – you want to make sure your appointment is different. Confirm it one day before, and one hour before.

You could ask them about the price – what is the lowest price they will see it for, or whether they will negotiate, but be ready for vague, non-committal answers or for simple refusal to discuss it. Don’t put much faith in promises made remotely, and don’t bother making offers. Your best chance on getting a lower price is in person, once you saw the car and ready to buy it.

When you are there in person – check that you are looking at the actual car you saw on line – same VIN. Make sure it has the advertised options – websites and software make mistakes, it is your responsibility to check it before purchase. Test-drive it. Seriously – drive it before you move forward. It doesn’t matter if your cousin has one like that. It is not enough if you drove one at another dealership – drive the car you are considering buying. Make sure that are no warning lights, everything works, and it drives well.

After you drove it – it is decision time. Are you ready to own it now? There are 3 answers to this question: you are ready to own it now for the asking price (it doesn’t mean you are going to pay it), you are ready to own it for some price, or you are not ready no matter what – either there is something wrong with the car, or you feel that you have to see and try something else before making a buying decision. If you are not ready own it – state so, thank the sales person for their time and leave. It might be harder than it sounds, you might have to have to talk to a manager, but you just have to stay calm, don’t get baited by promises of some incredible deal, and repeat that you are not ready to own this car at any price. They might through numbers at you – don’t put much faith in them, they have no obligation in honoring them.

If you are ready to own it – say so, and be ready to sit down to talk numbers. Hopefully you did your research, you know what the market rate is, how much similar specific cars in the vicinity are priced. You should know what guides like KBB, Edmunds and NADA say a car like that should be priced.

Now, about guides: they are just that – guides. You can use them to your advantage, but don’t get emotionally attached to what they say, because KBB is not going to sell you a car or buy one from you. In the end market rate and your desire to own the car will determine what the price will be. Guides vary from one to another – how would you know which one is right? Some cars will sell well below the guides value because of market conditions, some will sell for much more, because it is a unique car, desirable configuration or low mileage. The only thing a guide will really determine is the amount you can finance, because a bank will not lend you more than a specific percentage of the “book value”.

Show time: you are sitting down against the sale person, and you get into the dreaded negotiation. First – you don’t have to negotiate. If you found the lowest priced car, you think the price is fair, you are ready to buy, you want to get it over with before the car gets sold – you could just buy it. But no one likes to leave money on the table, and if you are up to it – you can make a run for it. Here is how to make it simple and easy:

State that you are ready to buy it now. Be ready to discuss financing, tell them how much down payment you have, fill out the credit application. This shows commitment, and it indicates to the sales person and their manager that they are close to selling something, it gets them involved in the process.

Same something in the lines of: “I am ready to buy this car now, but the price is too high. I am willing to pay this much, and this is why: …”

There are only two valid reasons to why you are offering less: You either have research to show why the car should be sold for less (market rate, cheaper similar car being sold nearby, lower book value), or this is simply what you can afford. Things salespeople don’t care for: cheaper cars sold 500 miles away, cheaper cars sold privately, supposed bad condition of the car you want to buy. Reasons like that mean nothing, they just show you as an inexperienced negotiator, and they annoy the dealer. You don’t want them annoyed, you want them anxious to sell you a car, not to fight you. Don’t make it personal.

How much you should offer? Your offer should be reasonable, but with some margin built in to give up. Going up on your offer shows good faith, and it lets the dealer feel like they are winning.

It is normal for the sales person to “third party” use a real or imaginary decision maker like a manager. Don’t fight it, don’t insist on being in a hurry or talking to the manager. If you are to save a large sum of money – you will have to work for it, and a couple of hours is worth it even if you save only $500 of the sales price.

So you make or offer, and the sales person will either say that he will check with the manager, or that it is too low, in which case you tell them to still check with the manager.

The dealer makes the next move: they might accept your offer, they might make a counter offer, or they might say that it is too low. If they accepted, or make a counter offer that is agreeable to you – you are done. If their offer it too high, or there is no counter offer – you use your negotiation buffer to raise your offer, and state that this is your final offer, and see what happens.

I the dealer is not willing to budge, or they are not moving from their last offer – this is a decision point for you: you can accept the offer if your research shows that it is fair, or you can try your last resort – walking away. Politely explain that this is more that you think you should pay or can afford, tell them to contact you if they change their mind, and leave. They might catch you at the door, out on the parking lot, or call you an hour or a day later. Or they might let you leave. If they let you leave and didn’t contact you – you know your offer was too low. If you do this right, stay calm and appear reasonable – it will likely not come to that.

Process of financing, trade, dealer fees, paperwork – it will be the same as a new car purchase, except for one thing: warranty. Read thoroughly to understand what comes with the car. If it is a CPO – make sure you have proof the car is certified. Most brands will post conditions of their CPO programs on their website. If it is not certified and out of warranty – does the dealer offers any kind of warranty? Is there any kind of return policy? Do you have to pay for it? Is there a return/restocking fee? If they offer you a service contract – extended warranty – read through it. Can it be cancelled? Can it be purchased later? If it is not in writing – it is not real.

Long distance purchases: 99% it is not worth it. Out of state purchase creates issues with paperwork. You shouldn’t not buy a used car sight unseen without driving it. You don’t have any leverage in negotiation, because when you contact the dealer from 500 miles away – it tells the dealer that one of two things is happening: they either have the cheapest car within 1,000 miles, or they have the only car within 1,000 miles that you want. I might go through the motions of working out the paperwork to ship you the car out of state, but if a local customer shows up ready to take delivery – you best believe I will rather sell the car to him.

Things to look out for:

If a dealer refuses to provide a vehicle history reports such as Carfax or Autocheck –either walk away or consider getting your own. Don’t buy a car without it.

If a dealer doesn’t post a price – don’t bother. This means that this will be a grind, and the dealer is stuck in the eighties.

Fees: there should be no fees added to a price of a used car. Destination fee, handling fee, reconditioning fee, CPO fee – all of these are tricks, signs that you should not even be dealing with the dealer, let alone pay them.

You should know the advertised price of the car the day you shop for it, get it off the dealer’s website, print it out. You should not have to negotiate just to get the Internet price.

There should not be any requirements for rebates to qualify for, the Internet price should not be “after X amount down”, or any other conditions to get the advertised price. Any of those are signs telling you to walk away. Dealers that use these tricks will not learn unless enough people will stop giving them their money.

Finally, remember that you are buying a used car to save money, but there is a reason it is cheaper than a new car. In most cases – used cars are sold as is, because even a perfect car can suddenly develop issues. A car might through a warning light just as you leaving the dealership, and you are at the mercy of the good will of the dealer. We have a saying: “If you bought a car “as is”, drove it off the lot, and it broke in two halves – you own both halves”. There is no Lemon Law in regards to used cars. A pre-inspection is not a guarantee.

Think about these things when you are making decisions and browsing for cars – it might make sense to pay more now to avoid paying later, and it might make sense to pay for a peace of mind.","[1500.0, 500.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51x18k/how_to_shop_for_a_used_car_detailed_guide_repost/
t5_2qstm,The Math on Series I Saving Bond (ibond) Returns,"The Math on Series I Saving Bond (ibond) Returns With inflation being very high lately there has been a surge in community interest in Series I savings bonds, or ibonds, whose returns are pegged to the inflation rate. I see a lot of posts of people confused on how ibond returns function or who are misinterpreting the returns...typically overstating them.

Series I bonds have two returns.  A fixed rate of return which remains, as you might expect, fixed through the life of the bond and a variable rate which is based on inflation and is recalculated twice a year, specifically on May 1st and Nov 1st of each year.

The current fixed rate is 0% and the current inflation rate for the period from May 1st 2022 to Oct 31st 2022 is 9.62% annualized.  The next rate will be for the period from Nov 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 but that rate is yet to be determined on the basis of inflation up to that period.

When you purchase an ibond you get the fixed rate at the time of purchase for the life of the bond (which is currently 0%) and the inflation rate for 6 months from your date of purchase set to whatever the inflation rate is at the time, this is referred to as the composite rate.

What that means is that if you bought an ibond today you would get 0% + 9.62% composite rate annualized for the next 6 months from 5/1/2022 to 10/31/2022.  If you bought June 5th it would be from 6/1/2022 to 11/30/2022.  After that the next 6 months would be with whatever the next inflation rate is which will be announced Nov 1st plus 0%.

The rates of return, it should be noted, are annualized.  That means that for 6 months you will earn 9.62% at an annual rate, which would mean 9.62 / 12 = 0.802% per month or 4.81% for 6 months.  It does NOT mean that you will get a 9.62% return in 6 months which is a mistake I have seen get made.

Unlike many other bonds you do get compounding interest with ibonds however it compounds semiannually rather than the continuously you may be used to from stocks.  That means that every 6 months any accumulated interest thusfar will be added to the principal and that total will them be used as the basis for the next 6 months of interest.

There is an added stipulation which is you cannot withdraw the funds for 1 year and if you withdraw the funds between 1 year and 5 years then you will lose the last 3 months of interest.  The way this manifests is that the last 3 months of interest will not show in your balance if you check your account.

So, with all of that said, if you bought a $10k Series I bond sometime between 5/1/2022 and 10/31/2022 this is what your balance would look like month to month.  For now we will ignore the 3 month penalty but Ill bring that back in later at the end.

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Now, we don't know what the rate will be starting in November but with all the Fed is doing chances are its going to be a bit lower (but we don't know).  Lets assume the next period would be 6%.

At month 7 the interest starts to apply 6 month balance of $10k principal and $481 interest.  Its annualized again so its 0.5% per month

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Month 7: $10,533.40

Month 8: $10,585.81

Month 9: $10,638.23

Month 10: $10,690.62

Month 11: $10,743.03

Month 12: $10,795.43

But, due to the 3 month penalty, this is not what your account balance would look like if you checked it every month after your initial purchase.  It would look like this:

Month 1: $10,000

Month 2: $10,000

Month 3: $10,000

Month 4: $10,080.17

Month 5: $10,160.33

Month 6: $10,240.50

Month 7: $10,320.67

Month 8: $10,400.84

Month 9: $10,481

Month 10: $10,533.40

Month 11: $10,585.80

Month 12: $10,638.22

So, after one year you withdraw and you get your principal $10k plus the $638.22 interest.  However interest made off of a bond is taxed as income and as such will be taxed at whatever your marginal tax rate is.  So, for example, if your marginal tax rate is 24% then you will owe $153.17 in taxes which means your total return will be $485.05.  That means the return for a year would be 4.85%.

If you wait 3 more months and don't withdraw until month 15 then you will get the full annualized 9.62% for 6 months and example 6% annualized for 6 months or $10,795.43.  After taxes $604.53 which would be a 4.83% annualized return.  So in that scenario unless the next period is significantly higher inflation it would be better to just pull out at 12 months (depending on your goals).

ibonds are a great option for guaranteed return for any money that you don't need for one year but you will want as cash in the short term. For example say you want to buy a car in 2 years, i bonds would be a great place to stash money in two rounds of $10k purchases.  That said, longterm, ibonds are probably not the best investment. Total stock market longterm tends to return at \~9% for comparison. Regardless of how you view it though its important to understand what the returns will actually look like though so you aren't disappointed by assuming you are going to be seeing 10%+ returns off your ibond purchase.

**EDIT:**  thank you to u/zacce for pointing out some finer detail on the math the cause these values to be slightly off primarily due to rounding differences caused by the $10k bond basically being comprised of 400 individual $25 dollar bonds.  This causes the math to be slightly different resulting in being off by a couple of dollars.  His post on the details of that can be found here[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ug2deh/exact\_ibond\_interest\_calculation\_explanation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ug2deh/exact_ibond_interest_calculation_explanation/)

There is also a website calculator he linked to specifically for figuring out your ibond yields here.

**EDIT2:** Another major thing to consider with Series I bonds.  They are one of the only government bonds that offers compounding interest.  Series I savings bond interet compounds semiannually.  US Treasury bonds and notes do not compound.Why is this important?  Lets say (hypothetically, these rates don't exist) you could get a US Treasury bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 12% a year for 30 years every year or you could get a Series I Bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 8% a year for 30 years every year.  You can put $10,000 into one of them but only one.  Which one would you choose? How much would you end up with after 30 years?

Treasury bond, simple interest..no compounding.  Every year you get 12% of $10,000 so you get $1,200 every year for 30 years plus your principal back.  So you get $46,000.

Series I Savings bond, interest compounds semiannually.  Meaning every 6 months the accrued interest is counted as principal for the next round of interest.  So for the first 6 months you get $400, but for the next you get $416, and the next you get $433.  After 30 years you end up with $105,200.

Pay attention to compounding not just annualized rate of return, it matters.","[10.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10.0, 481.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10533.4, 10585.81, 10638.23, 10690.62, 10743.03, 10795.43, 10000.0, 10000.0, 10000.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10533.4, 10585.8, 10638.22, 10.0, 638.22, 153.17, 485.05, 10795.43, 604.53, 10.0, 10.0, 25.0, 10000.0, 10000.0, 1200.0, 46000.0, 400.0, 416.0, 433.0, 105200.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/uw5o7v/the_math_on_series_i_saving_bond_ibond_returns/
t5_2qstm,am i crazy or are the adults in my life pushing me towards potentially life-ruining financial decisions?,"am i crazy or are the adults in my life pushing me towards potentially life-ruining financial decisions? TLDR at the bottom bc this is VERY long but theres just so much to get through. 

The catalyst: my first and only car of 8 years—an unbelievably well traveled 2005 Acura—is taking its final breaths. She just couldn’t make it back through the mountain pass i commute through and is now stuck at my uncle’s house.

to clarify, as ive gotten a few of the same comment now. the acura is NOT. WORTH. SAVING. this is not an exaggeration. i have spent ~3k in the past 9 months alone trying to keep her going until finally the catalytic converters just went bad for the THIRD time in her 21 years on this earth. her mpg is atrocious. last week i went through half a tank of gas (9 gallons) in a SINGLE FUCKING DAY. any love i have had for this car has soured into resentment as she has slowly fallen into pieces. there is not a single part in her that doesn’t need replacing. hell, i could spend another 5k and maybe get another half a year out of her, MAYBE, but its just NOT WORTH IT. 

Here’s the facts. I am currently finishing up an unpaid internship that will not end for a month and a half. I have a job lined up, but I have made non-refundable plans to fly home for three weeks after my internship is over. That means I have no money coming in for over two months. I’m also planning on starting college, and will have to start apartment hunting in about 6 months, which will both add additional financial strain. I have about $2000 in savings, and my grandpa and dad have both offered $500 each to help with a down payment, and my grandpa has offered to cosign on a loan. this is all incredibly generous of them both and i’m very grateful but…they do say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 

Anyways, in preperation for this day, I have been browsing the local used car markets to get an idea of what is out there. FBM, ksl, carmax, the like. I was looking for cars in the $1,500-2,000 range and had seen a lot of really good deals for the price, but my dad dismissed that completely when i talked to him over the phone this morning. he gave me very specific (and unrealistic if you ask me) perimeters. he insisted that i look for subaru outbacks, no older than 2010, within the 4,000-5,000 range. I find a couple that are not bad, but for that price theres usually SOMETHING wrong with them. i stumbled on a great little 2003 forester that had clearly been loved and well taken care of. its clean, the engine is in remarkably good shape. it has 220k miles and is only $2,225. i kinda fell in love with it but my dad insists its a bad investment. 

Anyways next day i was telling my grandpa (who i live with) about the couple potential options id found. He didn’t like any of them and decided to give me his own (even more unrealistic) perimeters on what to look for. 2010 or newer, $5,000-8,000 range, less than 100k miles. I somehow found a couple that

One that i thought had potential was a 2008 Outback and has taken great care of her car and put a lot of money into keep it in good shape. She has records of all the work done. Its clean, comes with a new spare tire and also what i estimate is ~$350 in tools and emergency supplies. Another solid find but apparently nothing but a clean title will do so it doesnt affect his credit score. Which is valid, but…SOMETHING has to give, here.

I tell him so and he decides that the thing that has to give is the PRICE. He ups it to $10,000. I’m not necessarily a fan but he’s cosigning so ok. I don’t really find anything good online so he decides its time to go do a dealership.

We find a subaru dealership and they have an 2013 outback listed for…$11,000. yippee. He also shows us a 2017 forester listed for $14,444 and oh whoops how convenient the outback actualy already has a deposit on it. But now my grandpa is  genuinely considering this almost $15,000 car!

Just two days ago i would have said $5,000 is too much. how the hell did we get here??? Probably because my granddather is a remarkably successful businessman and also incredibly persuasive. And, unfortunately, I am too uneducated about finances and probably too trusting in the intelligence of a 84 year old so i was more or less going along with it. 

We left to run errands and planned to come back later. He’s talking about $200 monthly payments (for SIX YEARS???) and actually finalizing right fucking then and my dumb ass was just going along with it. Luckily the salesman was taking someone else on a test drive so we went home 

My dad agrees that he’s being unreasonable, but still wants me to take out a $5,000 loan and i have an equally bad feeling about that as well. They’re approaching this like its going to be a future family car but mf i’m barely starting college! Am i crazy??????

The third route i’m considering is to take out a much smaller loan of $2,000 to get the forester. Since it matches my $2,000 in savings, plus the $500 each my dad and grandpa have offered to put towards a down payment, i’d be able to make above-minimum monthly payments right off the bat before i am even back in a position of financial stability. Feel free to tell me if this plan sucks too, i am financially illiterate and have no real idea what im talking about💀

Anyways i would LOVE ya’lls thoughts because i feel like im going insane over all this



TLDR: Car broke down, both dad and grandpa want me to take out an auto loan to buy a used subaru outback. dad says $5,000, grandpa ups it to $8,000, then $10,000, now is trying to convince me to buy a $14,000 car. I have $2,000 in savings, no pay coming in for 2 months and am about to start ONLINE college. Am i right to be wary, or would listening to them not potentially fuck me over for life?

to answer repeated questions: 
my first semester of college will be all online. I live in a small mountain town with NO public transportation to speak of and no close by amenities. The closest grocery store isn’t even technically in MY town, but the one we are a tiny offshoot from. I cannot live without a car as i will have no way of taking care of myself and will be stranded in the house. i do technically live with my grandparents but they are constantly gone for weeks at a time. I cannot go to work without a car. I cannot leave the house without a car. If i could manage without one i would but it is genuinely not an option in my current situation. my current car was in absolutely terrible, borderline unsafe to drive shape even before this past week. she is a 20 year old tboned salvage title my dad bought for 2k 8 years ago. girl has 250,000 miles under her belt and not a single reliably working part to her name with the breaking point issue being bad catalytic converters for the THIRD time. she has reached the end, simple as that. 

Also i live in utah. Lots of mountains, shitty cracked roads, harsh winters. subarus arent the best, but around here they are the goat. 


UPDATE: Talked to my mom, who ironed out some misunderstandings. This isn’t meant to be a big financial burden. They are willing to cover the monthly payments until i’m able to start my job. They are also willing to take over if my finances ever get too strained. Its more about me starting to build good credit, and while i will be doing everything i can to take care of the payments alone as it is MY car, they will always step in if i can’t. I was also able to somewhat reason with my grandpa on his expectations. i found a 2012 subaru forester with 94k miles for $8k. The monthly payment is estimated at $150 which totally works with my projected budget. the dealership has a really solid reputation. i’m optimistic!","[2000.0, 500.0, 1500.0, 2225.0, 5000.0, 350.0, 10000.0, 11000.0, 14444.0, 15000.0, 5000.0, 200.0, 5000.0, 2000.0, 2000.0, 500.0, 5000.0, 8000.0, 10000.0, 14000.0, 2000.0, 8.0, 150.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ejp3rh/am_i_crazy_or_are_the_adults_in_my_life_pushing/

Anyone can do some, or all, of these things. ***edited to address somr of thr most common comments i am getting :)

Clarity - I am in Canada not the USA. I am a female.  Late 20's. Small rural community on an island. 

In my early 20's I made many foolish decisions financially. I grew up poor and didn't know anything about money. Now that I am in my later 20's I am paying the price. Literally. 
So I started working on ways to save money, make more money, make my life simpler, live within my means, and work towards eliminating a certain portion of my debt and possibly consolidating the rest in a debt counseling program.
But mainly what this post is about are some simple ways to help people get started, or make a difference.
Maybe you have thought of some already, maybe not, but if this helps anyone out even a little, then it is worth my time typing it up!

In no particular order, these are some steps I have taken since the beginning of 2016. For clarity, I am a Canadian woman. 

~switched to a no-fees bank account, that also pays interest. So I save money, and I make a little extra from the interest. Every dollar counts. 
My old bank was charging me $14.95/month for my checking and savings account. No interest paid. Charged for checks, and charged for services such as a Stop Payment.
My new bank (Tangerine) charges $0/month for my checking and savings. They pay a small amount of interest on balances in checking and savings. First book of checks are free. 1 free stop payment a year.
Overall this saves me about $200 a year give or take. And i am not sure what the interest will be but more than 0 so it is good.

~Called both of my credit card companies and asked for the lowest possible interest rate. Both were able to do so. 
Card #1 lowered my interest rate from 19% down to 11%. 
Card #2 lowered my interest rate from 19% to 11.9% with a once yearly fee of $60. Just goes to show you it never hurts to ask. Communication is key. ***Most companies would rather help you, or make a payment agreement with you, than pursue your account and send it to collections <---- they will lose money if they do this.

~Went meatless. Look it's not that hard. It is so much less expensive. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cheaper than meat where I live. Yes I get more than enough protein and I am incredibly healthy and fit. I can make many delicious meals. 
You also tend to spend less going out to eat because there aren't as many options. This is a good thing. Good for your health and your wallet. No fast food. No chain restaurants. I REALIZE THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE OK THANK YOU :) but it can help some people.

~Sell items I don't need or want. 2 Lululemon hoodies. Dirtbike gear that I likely would not use again. Etc. Used the money for sensible things like groceries and my overdue credit card bill.

~Get a cheaper cell phone plan! Another one of those ""at least you can ask"" scenarios where your provider may give you a deal if you've been a customer for a long time. If they don't, shop around until you find a good deal. The BEST times of the year to do this are ""back to school"" (late aug - late sept), or Black Friday (this is usually a whole weekend of deals in store and online), and Christmas. Often $0 phone deals, good plans, extra data especially around back to school. You can also search online for deals.

~this one may not be for everyone but I needed a bed, and I did a lot of research... ended up buying a hammock and a stand instead of a mattress and frame. OK WAIT. I know it sounds odd but... the whole setup was $250, *edit - i checked my receipts and it was $166.87 CAD. It saved me a lot of money. & my back is fine thank you to the many commenter who were concerned about that. But there are entire countries where a hammock is normal for a bed and they all can still walk and function. I appreciate the concern however. Thank you all.

~take people up on their offers to help. Really, my friends and family have been great. They often offer help (I don't mean give me money) and I rarely take it. But this year I am trying to change my ways. A friend offered me a few months rent free in his apartment. It's fully furnished except the bedroom I'd be in. I accepted and am eternally grateful. For my birthday my dad offered instead of a tangible gift (I didn't want gifts anyways, and I am trying to cut down on ""stuff"") that he would pay off the remaining $500 on a student loan I took out in 2007 and had paid down from $10,000 down to $500 in 2016. That loan is now eliminated completely from my monthly bills.  This also isn't for everyone.

~Cancel your gym/yoga/pilates/karate memberships. You can do almost any workout at home using your computer and YouTube. Its free. I'm assuming you have the internet of course, but most do You can also make a one time investment in a dvd or two if you don't want to use up data or you'd rather use a TV and can't hook up your phone or laptop to it. You can fill old milk jugs with water and use them like kettlebells. You can do squats, lunges, jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, yoga, planks, and much more without any equipment at all. Maybe a mat and again that would be a 1 time investment. Sometimes if you can't cancel the agreement you can transfer it to someone else. I have done this in the past using Kijiji. This will save you on average $50/month, or $600/year. IF YOU ARE A GYM LOVER I GET IT OKAY :) You don't have to do this - I hope to re open a member ship when I can. It is a temporary money saving tactic for me. Best of luck on your gainz.

~Assess your car insurance. I went in to renew my insurance and was able to get it from $140/month to $109/month. I could save even more ($29 finance fee & %2.5 interest) if I purchased the insurance all at once, and didn't pay through monthly installments, but I do not have that much cash set aside unfortunately. ***This reinforces the often pointed out fact in Personal Finance threads that having personal savings is just as important as paying down debt.

~Get a 2nd part time job. I am working 2 jobs with strange hours right now. So I have applied for 2 jobs in the hopes of getting another (3rd)one to supplement my income. One of the jobs is a part time overnight stock position - not terribly exciting or rewarding BUT it is not forever and it is extra money. The other job is only for 2 months but it pays well, working for the Federal Census (big survey Canada does to discover info about demographics). Fingers crossed. If I get neither of these positions then I will continue to apply for other similar ones and work as much as I can in my original job as well. So I am trying to bring in extra money. 

~change the way you give gifts. I am trying to give people less ""stuff""... consume less. So I sometimes make a donation to the SPCA in the name of the gift recipient. Or to a cause close to that person's heart depending on their individual personalities and life experiences. Or I buy some groceries and we make a meal together. Or have an ""everyone bring 10 bucks"" party and order as much vegetarian take out we can get with the total. (may have to adjust a bit depending on where you live but you get my drift) this is also not for everyone I get that. My circle is ok with this. Not everyone will be in the same boat. 

~make an honest budget. get out your calculator. Make all those columns and lines. Fill in every little thing. All your bills. All your vices. How much do you really spend on groceries? (Hint - look back through 1 month of bank statements, you can do that on any banking app, any mobile website for your bank, any paper bank statement) How much cash? where does it go? Gas stations for fuel? Get areal clear picture. It will help you. Remember, keep 10% minimum of every paycheck aside in a savings account for you - whichever one will give you the highest interest rate while still allowing you access to your funds (and I always have a few rolls of loonies and a few 20's stashed as well just in case) and incorporate that into your budget.

~consider seeing a non profit debt counselor. They can often help you lower or eliminate your interest and other fees, consolidate your debt into one monthly payment instead of spreading your money between all your debts and trying to just make the minimum payment on everything. *Note - some debts, such as student loans, are not eligible for this service. Please do the appropriate research.

~stay away from shopping malls and TV. Malls make you want ot spend money. Don't go places where the temptation will be great. TV commercials make you want to spend money. They are designed to do so. You don't need any of that crap. It is not as important as what you are saving and working so hard for. Opening your own business. Taking a program at College. Going on a trip. Being debt free. All of these things are more important than a new shirt or the latest shoes or KFC or the latest cell phone...

~Walk more. I have a car. But I live within a reasonable walk to a Loblaws Superstore (kind of like Wal Mart for those of you not in Canada) & a pet supply store (for dog food). Save the gas. Save the wear & tear on your car.

~if you're partnered, do free or very cheap dates. Fly kites somewhere cool. If you don't have a beach you might have a cliff or the roof of a bulding... flat roof... haha. Make a craft. Have a cook-off. Go for a walk where 1 of you is blindfolded and the other one has to guide you over obstacles. Do chin ups on the monkey bars. Go to an open mic night for music and atmosphere. Read aloud on the beach. Go for a drive somewhere to watch the sun set. Write down your goals and then burn them off a candle flame into the wind. You know just think outside of the box.
 (I am single and not interested in dating for a while when I'm sorting out my life so idk just suggestions)

Most of all just don't give up and keep making changes in small ways and you will get there. I was so hopeless a year ago and now I am starting to feel better. Things are starting to look up. I am still in a huge amount of debt but now I have made a dent in it and have a plan to continue doing so. I am able to sleep better at night knowing I am really doing everything I can think of to make my situation better and I am constantly looking for new ways and new ideas. 
Like I said not everyone can do all of these things but everyone can do at least 1 or 2 of these things, even right now, today, after reading this, you can do some of these things right away. Don't procrastinate. And keep your chin up.

I took advantage of the federal student loan pause to pay down my loan with the highest interest rate (5.41%) and was able to get the loan down to $6,500. Now that the pause is ending I'm wondering if I should try to pay off the rest to avoid paying the interest later. The only reason I wouldn't is that I'm considering buying a house this year or next and would use that money for part of the down payment. Additionally, with mortgage rates as high as they are, it seems to make sense to put any extra money toward the mortgage instead of a loan with a lower interest rate.",[6500.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15pafgw/should_i_pay_off_my_student_loan_now/

I urged people to consider the power of compounding and the wonders it can produce if allowed to work its magic. Also within that post, I mentioned that I strived to become a 401k millionaire someday, and this week, thanks to years of consistent savings and a long bull market, that goal [has come to fruition](https://i.imgur.com/ihNtSod.png), at the ripe age of 45.

First, I want to iterate that I do recognize how fortunate and privileged I am to be able to achieve this milestone. I am extremely lucky to have been born without any major disabilities or health issues, and I am very grateful to be able to participate in a society where the opportunities and resources to achieve personal successes exist. Furthermore, I believe I was lucky to have been born into extreme poverty, for it ignited a fire within me to do everything within my power to escape my circumstances. I refused to allow my situation to define me, and I focused my time & energy on the things within my influence to improve my life.

Because I grew up in poverty, I've held a job in some form or fashion since I was 10 years old. The ones I worked in my youth were tedious and low paying, but they taught me to not be afraid of hard work. They also motivated me to find better & higher paying jobs, and to that end I pursued getting my education since I lacked any special gifts or talents for earning a lot of money easily. My youth was not like that of most people I know. It was comprised entirely of school, work, and study. There was little time for leisure, and even during school breaks I would borrow books for the subsequent semester to get a jumpstart on the material. Thankfully the effort paid off, and I was able to do well enough in school to qualify for some scholarships for college. I went to the cheapest institution I could find, and when choosing a major, I decided to pursue engineering as it suited my strengths in math & science *and* offered careers with higher earning potential, as opposed to one that simply followed my passion (art).

Upon graduating college (with around $10k in student loans), I landed my first professional job, which paid a handsome annual salary of $28k. I continued living intentionally and aligned my actions to my values & priorities. As Dave Ramsey is known for saying, ""live like no one else now, so later you can live like no one else"". I was accustomed to living in poverty, so I knew how to survive on a lean budget. Achieving a financially stable and secure life was more important and rewarding to me than stuff I could accumulate or luxurious experiences I could buy, which allowed me to avoid the YOLO mentality and FOMO mindset. Also, as a Gen X-er, I started my career in an era of disappearing pensions and the advent of outsourcing/offshoring. I watched good paying, stable jobs disappear overnight, and loyal, long term employees left suddenly without the incomes and secure retirements they had come to expect. That motivated me to treat my income like lottery winnings, and maximize my savings rate to ensure that I never had to worry about relying on a job for survival or face the prospect of being in poverty again.

I wasn't the most knowledgeable investor, and didn't learn about low cost passive index funds until my late 30s. However, I was fortunate to work for a company early on in my career that explained the power of compounding and the benefits of tax advantaged savings, which encouraged me to participate in my 401k program. I knew I had a long investing time horizon, which helped me to develop a high risk tolerance and feel comfortable with putting most of my contributions into equities. I ignored short term market volatility (which many of my coworkers had trouble handling during the 2000 and 2008 recessions, to their unfortunate detriment), and as I gained work experience & skills I strategically job hopped to pursue higher income opportunities. I looked for jobs with solid 401k benefits, such as low fees and generous employer matching, so that I could continue to take advantage of that savings vehicle.

Achieving any long term goal requires consistency and discipline, and the ability to break it down and attack it one small bite at a time--while keeping an eye on the larger prize. It's no different for finances, and each of us has to decide if it's worth making some trade offs today in order to have a brighter and more abundant tomorrow. I've had some people tell me that it's important to enjoy the present, as there is no guarantee that there will be a tomorrow. However, the reality is that tomorrow will likely come for most of us, so it's prudent to plan for it.","[10.0, 28.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7l3fuy/this_is_what_can_happen_if_you_contribute_to_your/
t5_2qstm,"If you're worried about digging yourself out of a hole starting, start now. The difference one year makes.","If you're worried about digging yourself out of a hole starting, start now. The difference one year makes. January of 2014 I freaked out. I was past due on my car payment and credit cards. I was making minimums on everything (despite making a very good salary). and constantly broke. I had about $2,000 in my savings+checking accounts combined. My credit score had tanked to 580. I was sitting around 85% CC utilization. I was at my wits end. I'd started avoiding opening bills, looking at statements (or even my bank account balances) out of fear. I did not answer calls from unknown numbers, because while my iPhone didn't know who was calling, I sure did. I was not in control.  
  
I got my shit in order. Things had to change. I put myself on a budget, added all my accounts to Mint, and began using the spare money at the end of each month to pay off credit cards instead of blowing it on something I wouldn't care about the next day. Meals were prepped at home and taken to work, happy hours were cut down to a beer or two (and no more rounds on me), and it became almost a game; how much money can I shove into debt and savings this month?   
  
  
Today, just over one year later, everything is current. I'm at 27% utilization on my cards. I have a safety net of $12,000 in my savings account. My credit score, as of this morning, is 696. Four of my credit cards have auto-increased my limits. On top of that, I managed to take a vacation to Hawaii for 5 days, paying entirely in cash (no longer will I be a slave to credit cards - I use them responsibly for their rewards, pay them in full, and everything else gets paid in cash). Yes, my credit snafus are still on my report. They are falling off one by one. This will take time, but the process is in motion.   
  
The purpose of this post is not as a humblebrag, but to tell you ignoring the source of your financial woes does not help. It hurts.

t5_2qstm,"Car broke down as I was saving to buy a new one, now in a pickle.","Car broke down as I was saving to buy a new one, now in a pickle. Hi,

I've been driving my old beater 2003 CTS for years now. I've been saving for a downpayment on a new car but due to a rainy day last month I had to use all my savings.

I have $1500 earmarked for a downpayment for a new car right now and planned on buying one in January. Yesterday my car wouldn't start. I had expected this as I knew the starter was most likely on its way out so I took my spare starter and had my car towed to a repair shop where I learned that the damage was much more severe than I imagined. There was a lot more that needed replacing than just the starter and the total for all repairs came out to ~$4k. I'm not that interested in paying 80% of my car's value in repairs while also setting myself back again when it comes to buying a new car.

My office is in a part of town where the buses that run through don't start until after I need to get to work and unless I leave work early won't be able to catch one home. I live 30 minutes from work. 

I've been looking into what cars I should buy and honestly am at a little loss. I've never bought a car before besides my CTS and I want to buy something that will last me a long time. The car market, however, is slightly strange at least in my area. Every used car I can find is somewhat to significantly more expansive than a new car! The car I'm most interested in is a civic but at this point I will take anything. I'm not interested in buying a cheap beater just for me to have to repeat this process again but at the same time buying a new car feels wrong to me.

I can afford something decent. I make $60k/yr, my rent is $2.1k (HCOL), my car insurance is only $140. 

Ideally my plan in 2023 was to buy a new car and rent cheaper/get a roommate/move in with my SO which would generally bring my rent down from $2k to something like $800-1100.  I planned on buying a new car as I can afford it and for the past 5 years have been stressed out over this beater I drive and really want something reliable that I don't need to constantly worry about and rack up repair costs. 

My problem is that the car I was hoping to last until January died earlier than I thought it would. I can afford car payments but I want to have sizable downpayment even something like $5k would be nice as it would lower my monthly.

My credit score is 650 (jumped on the credit building train late, started off with medical debt I was unaware of, I thought that should be wiped but it's still affecting my credit score)

I am not old enough to rent a car in my state.

I would appreciate any advice. This is uncharted waters for me and I don't have any family and friends to really lean on. I've been wondering if a credit union would be a good option but either way I need a car sooner rather than later.","[1500.0, 4.0, 60.0, 2.0, 140.0, 2.0, 800.0, 5.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/yx0ypj/car_broke_down_as_i_was_saving_to_buy_a_new_one/

t5_2qstm,Sheriff house auction buyer beware! We are losing the house but have to continue paying a mortgage for no house.,"Sheriff house auction buyer beware! We are losing the house but have to continue paying a mortgage for no house. My wife and I bought a house at the sherrif’s auction January 2020 with a secured loan from the bank. We recieved the deed from the sherrif’s auction. We began to fix the house up. Consisting up tearing up flooring, replacing windows, painting the entire house, fixing walls and ceilings. When we went to get the abstract we found out there was a second lien on the property not disclosed when purchased at the auction.

We got a lawyer and the lawyer attempted to contact the bank with the second lien. The bank could not find any loan for this property. A couple of months later we have a guy walk in the house to inspect and change the house locks. We continued to work on the house with the okay from the lawyer. Another notice was left on our house detailing it was empty. Our lawyer said to continue working on the house and it will just take time. This went on for an entire year.

About last month we get notified from bank 2 that we either pay the second lien that is owed or they will take the house and put it back on the sheriff’s auction. The amount owed is around $114,000 not including the loan we already have of the house. Our options came down to paying bank 2 to go away or have the house taken. We attempted to negotiate and offered 50k. Bank 2 gave no response and told us they will be putting it in the auction soon. My wife and I decided to offer 100k and was turned down by bank 2. It was reported by our lawyer that bank 2 said they were going to be putting it on the auction again because they can get more money. Our options come down to continuing to negotiate with the bank in hopes they’ll go away or lose the house and continue to pay a house loan for no house. Our offer of 100k was already pushing it so at this point we’re out of options. My goal is to bring awareness and help other people not get in this same situation. I am currently working on a video that details all of this along with before and after pictures/videos of the house.

Thank you for reading.

Edit. Added one more sentence to the TLDR

Edit2: this happend in Iowa,USA. My mother law in law took out the secured loan then it was going to be switched to my wife and I after we fix up the house. This “plan” was recommended to use by our bank who gave us the secured loan. 

Edit 3: currently at work but i’ll try and answer you guys as soon as I can and provide more info. 

Edit 4: I used the word “mortgage “ but it’s not. I’m not very knowledgeable in this area. To clarify my mil got a secured loan from the bank using her house as collateral as recommended by our bank. After we fixed the house some, the loan would then be transferred to my wife and I. We would then start a mortgage. 

Edit 5- anyone know a good place to upload our before and after video? Some expressed wanting to see it but I don’t believe I can include it in this sub. 

Edit 6- Some have pointed out Iowa does not have title insurance. My mil has looked into other real estate lawyers and has had no luck.

t5_2qstm,Adventures in Apartment Hunting or: Sometimes the More Expensive Option is Actually Cheaper,"Adventures in Apartment Hunting or: Sometimes the More Expensive Option is Actually Cheaper ETA2: Here's a [link to a version of our spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SX3rzTk6q3c5NOiSmox4lwaAKp5OX1NppYU4SFAXTjE/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
I simplified it a bit (to reduce the number of rows/columns to something more manageable). The first tab is just a place to easily view information regarding the apartment, and your own 'progress' as far as making calls/visits. Pros/Cons is all personal opinion, we just put whatever we immediately noticed and loved/hated. Columns for distance (in time and miles) from the apartment to each of our jobs. Then the last column for a link to the apartment online.  
  
The second tab I super cleaned up, and you'll likely have to expand it to include more columns. The basis behind it is: the thing you're rating, how high/low you'd rate it, and how important it actually is. For example, the grounds might be really nice (3) but the grounds really don't matter that much to you (4). Or the kitchen appliances are shit (-3) and that's something that's super important to you (10). It then gives each apartment a total score, and you can more easily quantify non-tangible qualities of the apartment.

I left in 2 example rows in case you need an example to follow.
This link is 'read only' shared via Google Docs. You'll need to save a version of it to your own Google Drive in order to edit the spreadsheet.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ETA: I wanted to clear up a few questions/comments, and add some useful information some people have contributed.  
  
* I probably should have included this from the get-go, but didn't think of it. We live in a suburb in the midwest (if you didn't figure as much based on the apartment prices!). A lot of my experience doesn't apply to more densely populated areas. If you're somewhere like New York or San Francisco it sounds like you've got to show up when the current tenants are moving out, with a whole years salary cash in hand, prepared to fight to the death against any one else who shows up! Do as much research into places you're looking to move as you can.

* There's a LOT more to choosing a place to live than *just* the costs. In many (if not most) cases, a higher price is worth the non-tangibles you get. My larger point was to do the math, because it might be surprising. We would have chosen the higher priced apartment regardless, because it was the better choice for us. But it was a nice surprise to find the costs were much closer than they seemed.   
  
* Our estimated utility costs were a combination of A) the estimate the apartments gave us, B) estimates directly from the utility companies, and C) an average of our utilities in our current, similarly sized apartment. It's definitely a valid concern, and something to be aware of. The previous tenant most likely has/had different lifestyle requirements than you and used under/over what you'll use. Get as many estimates as you can; /u/bridgehater1 suggested not only asking the average utility cost, but the highest and lowest cost.  
  
* A lot of people suggested [padmapper](http://www.padmapper.com/) as a good search tool for finding apartments. /u/qwilo also posted several links to [rental search websites, as well as rating/review websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zl03l/adventures_in_apartment_hunting_or_sometimes_the/cpk6fw2). /u/Smokey_Jah also posted a really informative article called [The True Cost of Commuting](http://lifehacker.com/5855550/the-true-cost-of-commuting-you-could-buy-a-house-priced-15900-more-for-each-mile-you-move-closer-to-work) that I think is incredibly relevant to choosing where to live. Definitely worth a read for anyone house/apartment hunting!
  
I'll be cleaning up my spreadsheet and questions document this evening, and can absolutely share it, for those of you who asked. I may have to share it in a new post. But for anyone who asked, I'll make sure to shoot you a message so you know it's up!

Lots of awesome advice throughout the whole thread. Thanks to everyone who's contributing!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
So my girlfriend and I have been apartment hunting for the last few months and have learned a LOT. I thought some of our mis-steps and new knowledge may be useful to others. I'll spoil the ending, the more ""expensive"" apartment ends up costing less money all around once we included every factor we could think of.  
  
**Choosing Apartments**  
  
The first step, and arguably the most difficult.  
  
We started out on [rent.com](http://rent.com). Filtered for not only our price range (under $800/month total), but also our ""must haves"" (washer and drying in unit, and a balcony). We then expanded out to other apartment finding websites. Then even went as far as going into Google Maps and just typing in ""apartment."" The Google Maps step was difficult, since all of the information we wanted to find wasn't as organized as it is on a dedicated apartment finding website. But it more than doubled our options.   
  
**Important Note:** Include apartments that are slightly above your price range. If your max cost for *the apartment only*, not including utilities is $800, go ahead and grab a few that are around $825-850. You'll see why toward the end. 
  
**Narrowing Down the Search**  
  
I'm a spreadsheet junkie, I can't deny that. I put together a master spreadsheet of every apartment we found that met our requirements. Rows for each apartment. Columns for information like price, location, distance to your most frequently visited places (work, mom&dad's house, nearest grocery store, a friend that you visit regularly, etc.), 'extras' (pool, balcony, private entrance, pets allowed, etc.), as well as 'cons' (near a railroad track, was our biggest con).   
  
We then assigned a number value to each thing, 1-3. Three being ""yes, this is super awesome and we want it,"" two being ""this is ok, but not enough to have a major opinion on,"" one being ""meh."" We also assigned negative points for the negative things (-3 for being close to a railroad track, for example). I added up points for all of the apartments, and that's how we sorted out where to start. It's also where we completely cut out places. *This was all done before we even stepped foot onto a property*.  
  
**Visiting Apartments**  
  
We then put together a big sheet of questions to ask at each apartment. Typed up and printed. It included the name of the apartment, and the person we met with. This ended up being invaluable because, as those of you who have gone looking at places know, when you look at several places in one day it all starts to blur together. This gave us the opportunity to sit down at the end of the day and have our information organized (and add it to our spreadsheet!).  
  
Some of the questions we included were: what utilities are we responsible for? What's the average cost of those utilities? What is your rent payment policy and grace period? What are the options for paying rent? (check, money order, payment portal online, etc.) How is maintenance handled? Are they on-site? What's the turn around on maintenance requests? Is there separate emergency maintenance? (no one wants their only toilet out of order and have to wait for it to be fixed!) What are the most common complaints you get from residents? What is the turn over rate here? (this is a big one, if residents are staying for a long time, that's awesome!)  Will we have the opportunity to see **our** unit before we sign the lease? Can we take a copy of the lease with us today to look over? What's the application process like? What do you require as part of our application? How much is the application fee? Does it get refunded if we're denied? How long will it take from handing you the application to getting an answer?
  
We also (naively) inquired about the demographics, primarily trying to find out if there are a lot of younger people and/or kids, since they tend to be more noisy. As we were told by one of our favorite office managers: Under law, apartment complexes are not legally allowed to answer this question. Any apartment that willingly tells you anything beyond, ""We accept any and everyone who meets our qualifications, and our qualifications are the same for everyone"" is breaking the law, and maybe not the greatest place to choose.  
  
Check everything. Windows, doors, lights, water. Touch things. Ask questions. Don't be shy. This is the place you're going to be living. Make note of what you find. Point out questionable things; there may be a good explanation (i.e.-this carpet looks crappy, what's the deal? answer: we replace the carpet after every move out, so don't worry about it). TAKE NOTES, for real, it's important. Again, you will not remember which place had which issues, and you'll be stressed out about it later.  
  
**Picking Where to Apply and Applying**  
  
Because most places require an application fee, it's not really an option to apply everywhere. So you have to narrow it down. We narrowed it down to 2 places.  
  
This step doesn't have much wiggle room. You pretty much have to follow their application procedures. But a big thing you can do to help yourself is not to apply somewhere you already know you won't be approved. If they require residents to make 3X the cost of rent a month and you don't make that much, don't bother applying. If they require a 700+ credit score, and yours is too low, don't bother applying.   
  
*These are all things you should know, because you asked about the application process ahead of time!*  
   
  
**The Final Decision (and Some Math)**  
  
So you picked two or three places, applied and got approved at more than one. Now you have to make the final decision. You have to compare numbers, and intangibles.  
  
It's easy to look at two apartments, and make the decision based purely on how much they cost. But is the less expensive apartment really less expensive? I'm going to break down the two apartments we choose from. These expenses are all calculated as monthly expenses. So, for example, our gas usage to and from work is (X*2)*30 (I went with an even 30 days a month for the sake of not confusing myself with math!)
  
 | Apartment A | Apartment B
---------|----------|----------
Rent | $770 | $825
Electric/Gas | $130 | $100
Water | $25 | $0 (included) 
Monthly Cost of Gas to Work  (*Combined*) | $38.40 | $38
Laundry Costs (*at 1 load each per week, total of 8 loads a month*) | $18/month | None; W&D in unit
**Total Monthly Cost** | **$981.40** | **$963.00**  
  
*Note: the electric and gas costs were estimated by each apartment complex, AND confirmed independently by the electric and gas companies*    
  
I also calculated the cost per square inch, because that's really the only way (in my opinion) you can compare two different sized, different priced places:  
  
 | Apartment A | Apartment B

Price per Square Foot (*here you can already see the more expensive apartment is a better value*) | $1.32 | $1.06
  
So, the price difference isn't huge. It comes out to **$18.40** (or $220.80 for a 12-month lease), which is really just the difference in cost between having or not having a washer and dryer. Originally, our cutoff point for rent alone was $800/month. But once we added up all other costs (and conveniences) we came out ahead with the more expensive rent (plus, let's be real, we're two chicks, we're going to do more than 2 loads of laundry a week!).   
  
We also factored in several other intangibles that don't have a price attached. Apartment B has a private entrance, meaning we get the added benefit of not having hallway noise, Apartment B is closer to both of our parent's houses and her best friend, Apartment B is also closer to a grocery store, gas station and several restaurants/fast food places. Plus, laundry in your own place is a billion times better than a shared laundry room!! Apartment A is also directly next the dreaded railroad I've been complaining about this entire time.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
Factor in *all* costs when looking for a home (I've never bought a house, obviously, but I'm going to assume this holds true for home buying as well). A cheaper cost up front, with smaller expenses can add up to be more expensive than higher priced options. Those little expenses can close the gap between differently priced options real quickly.   
  
Please also remember, this is the place you'll be living. We would have chosen Apartment B even if it *had* come out slightly more expensive because of the added conveniences, and the 'gut' feelings we had walking into Apartment B. 
  
*I fully admit my math may be shaky, and there are probably a billion other factors that we didn't consider. This advice may or may not be applicable to others, but hopefully the general sentiment is helpful for some!*  
  
**tl;dr** Calculate all costs associated with any financial decision you make (housing, car, kids, pets, whatever). Small associated expenses can add up, and make the cheaper looking option equally or more expensive than the more expensive looking option.

t5_2qstm,Is AAA Plus Worth $200/Year for Two People?,"Is AAA Plus Worth $200/Year for Two People? A few months ago, I used my Erie auto insurance's roadside assistance when my wife locked her keys in the car. When it was time for renewal, I noticed an increase in my premiums. After shopping around with two independent agents, Erie was still the most affordable option among reputable companies, even after the increase.  
  
I checked my CLUE report and saw that the roadside assistance was listed as a claim, along with others from previous years (those were through Geico).  
  
Now, I'm considering switching to AAA for roadside assistance. The Plus tier, which offers 100 miles of towing, would cost us $200 per year for two people. This seems higher than what I've seen others mention.  
  
Given that I have a 2022 Subaru (which comes with its own roadside assistance but wasn't a great experience when I used it last year) and my wife drives a 2016 Mazda, is it worth paying $200 per year for AAA?  

Edit: thanks everyone. I ended buying it but at a lower rate ($142). At first I was hesitant so after entering my cc i closed the page without paying.

t5_2qstm,"Buy a home now and resell later, or rent for now and buy our first home later?","Buy a home now and resell later, or rent for now and buy our first home later? Hi guys! My husband and I are in our early 20s and facing kind of a conundrum about housing.

We are INSANELY lucky in that my husband’s parents own a small house that we have been living in for the past year. They had previously been renting it out and their last tenants completely destroyed the place- I cannot even describe how run-down and pest infested it was. We’ve been paying them only $600/month to live here and also fixing up the place, and we’ve put a lot of work into it to increase its value. For the past year we’ve been living on only my husband’s salary (about 50,000/year) while I’ve been finishing school, but starting this month I have my first “grown-up” job and I’ll add my own 50,000/year salary to the mix! 

They’ve offered to sell the home to us for well below market value, and we would have a really low mortgage which would allow us to put a lot into savings. My only hesitation is that my husband and I both agree that this town isn’t one we want to live in forever, and especially not one that we’d want to raise kids in. We currently both work in a neighboring county. We are both teachers who chose to work in this adjacent county rather than our own due to much higher pay, more diverse and inclusive schools, and more opportunities for ourselves and our students. Our contract hours are from approximately  6:30 AM to 3 PM. My 30 minute commute is a little draining- his almost hour long commute is a nightmare. We love teaching but it’s already a super demanding job. Due to meetings, extra work, and rush hour traffic he frequently doesn’t get home until 6-7 PM. 

We love our jobs and the county we work in. We both agree that before we have kids (4-6 years) we want to be living in that county so we can spend more time at home and so our kids can go to this county’s schools (which are generally more diverse and offer a lot more opportunities). 

So all of this is to say… knowing we want to move to another county, does it make sense to buy this house now, then try to sell it and move in a few years? If we do, we could put more into our savings (which are currently virtually non existent). However, I worry about getting “stuck” and giving up first-time home buyer assistance (we live in Georgia in the US, btw). This is really the biggest sticking point for me- I don’t know how feasible it’s going to be for us to sell this house later and be able to buy another one. We’ll be making decent money but not a ton, and saving enough to put down a down payment… just makes me nervous. 

Or does it make more sense to rent in the area we know we want to live in so we can take advantage of first time homeowner assistance later and buy a home we really love, and in the meantime we’re not going crazy over our commute?

I’m sure I’ve left out some important details- this is all super new to us and I’m just running myself in circles trying to make a decision and don’t want to look back and regret how we handled this.

t5_2qstm,"Must buy a car, sudden brainstorm about old 401K, now freaking out about amount IN the 401K","Must buy a car, sudden brainstorm about old 401K, now freaking out about amount IN the 401K TL;DR: should I cash out an old 401K to pay off student loan / buy a car, or roll over?

Basic info: Southeast USA, $41K annual income, $47K debt (all fed student loan, so currently on 'pause' for COVID), age 44, no credit cards, hardly anything on my credit report. My credit scores (whether you want to consider it ""real"" or ""fake"") are 681 (Experian FICO-8), 710 (TransUnion Vantage 3.0), 696 (Equifax Vantage 3.0). I had credit cards in the past, they got out of hand, so once I was able to get rid of them all, I stayed away. But having zero credit usage isn't doing me any good now. Nobody ever said ""hey, cellovator, if you don't have SOME kind of active credit usage, you're never gonna qualify for any kind of loan at a decent rate!"" My mom has no financial knowledge, so there was none to pass on to me. ((I'm not blaming anyone for my lack of knowledge, it's just a fact.))

A couple of weeks ago I was in a car accident (other driver's fault) and my car has been totaled by the other insurance company. Luckily, no injury, even luckier, I owned it outright. I'd already been saving to get a new car (pref. new, but at most 5 years old), so I already have $5k saved for a down payment. I won't go into describing the car market, we all know. So I've been totally stressed out about how I'm going to pay for a car, especially when student loan payments kick back in. Car shopping should be fun, right? NOT SO. I've thought about just going and pulling out the $5k from the bank and buying a beater from craigslist. But I really want something that will last a long time. The answer to that is something newer, which means finance. But with my credit profile...ugh.

About an hour ago I remembered that I have TWO different 401K plans that I have yet to roll over to my new job (started almost 2 years ago...I'm lazy). One plan I was only in the job for a little over a year, so that plan has been active for 3 years now. I can't even find the login information at the moment. But the other plan...I was at that job for almost 15 years. And I just remembered that it was just sitting there, waiting for me to roll it over, or take a payout, because if I'm no longer employed there, I can just cash it out, right? So I log in to look at the balance, which I haven't done in a REALLY long time. It's over $58k.

Now what??? If I take the payout, (from what I understand) I immediately lose 20% to the IRS, and then another 10% because it's an early withdrawal (not yet 59 1/2 age). My state doesn't have income tax. So that $58k shrinks to between $40,800-42,000, depending upon how the 10% is calculated. But that's $40k that I could potentially have.

Other factors: **1**. I don't expect to ever retire. I don't expect that my health will hold out that long, so sometimes I wonder why I even have a 401K. I do, however, always withhold the max for my HSA, which has always turned out to be a good decision. That's a long story, but I have zero medical debt, and it really could be so much worse. **2.** I would love to get out from under the student loan, because my payments haven't even been covering the interest (I'm on income-based repayment), so my balance each month (before COVID) was creeping slowly UP instead of down. And when that 25-year mark hits, I'll be liable for taxes on the amount that gets forgiven. **3.** I'm so tired of being stressed about this. I'm starting to see this as an easy way to get $40k.

Is this the stupidest thing you've ever heard of? Is it genius? Is it only slightly moronic?

Please, someone with more financial sense than me, tell me what you think.

EDIT: Ok, so you guys obviously are telling me ""don't touch your retirement!"". I genuinely was asking for reasons WHY, other than ""you'll need it later"", but whatever. Thanks anyway.

2nd EDIT: Thanks for the advice, folks, I’m going to leave the $58k intact and roll it on over. Other than that, I’m still at a loss for what to do.

3rd edit: This is what I come from: I just called my mom to tell her I was not cashing out, and her response was “why not?” Like I said, no financial knowledge.

Final edit: Found out today (8/23) that insurance payout is waaaaay more than I expected, so the 401(k) is definitely safe, guys! Put away the pitchforks LOL!

t5_2qstm,"Pay for engine rebuild, or sell as is and buy replacement now?","Pay for engine rebuild, or sell as is and buy replacement now? Hi all!  


I currently own two vehicles. One is a short-range electric car, and one is a gas van. The van was a passion project purchase, but since owning a vehicle with more range I've realized how much I missed being able to road trip. The situation is this: the van has cost far more in repairs than it is worth, and I count it a loss at this point. It currently needs a rebuild, which I was quoted $1800 for with a 2-year warranty. 

I am planning selling both the van and my EV to replace both with a plug-in hybrid which will have the best of both worlds and cost less to insure than both vehicles.

**My dilemma is this:** as is, I can probably sell the van for $2-3K. With a rebuilt engine, I could probably sell it for $5-6K. In addition, I am currently at a summer internship, and brought only my van. 

In my current location, the vehicle I plan to replace my cars with is about $2500 cheaper to purchase My dilemma is this, on average (after taxes and everything), than it would be back home. If I were to have the van rebuilt, it's likely I would take it home and sell it there, whereas if I sold it as is without the rebuild, I would either buy the replacement now, or fly home and buy it back home.  


As I see it, my best options financially are to sell the van as is and buy the replacement here, or to have it rebuilt, sell it for hopefully enough more to cover the rebuild, and then buy the replacement later. I've settled on replacing both vehicles with the one regardless, because the van isn't too practical as a daily vehicle and the plug-in hybrid would be a far better car than my two current ones combined.  


Advice, ideas, thoughts? While I like the idea of having the van to drive around and selling it for a bit more to recoup *some* of what I spent, I also realize that buying the replacement back home is likely to be enough more expensive that I won't gain anything there, unless I shop around for a better-than-average deal.","[1800.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2500.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15bl2z3/pay_for_engine_rebuild_or_sell_as_is_and_buy/
t5_2qstm,Am I being manipulated into signing away ownership of a home while retaining liability for the mortgage?,"Am I being manipulated into signing away ownership of a home while retaining liability for the mortgage? My (30F) and my mother (64F) have a strained but cordial relationship. Long story short I had to purchase her house under my name in 2018 because she was going through bankruptcy (her husband spent all their $150K HELOC gambling behind her back) and she needed my income and work history to qualify for a refinance.

I felt uncomfortable with the decision then but went ahead because she kept insisting there wasn’t any other way for her to keep the house and she said she was going to leave me the house in her trust anyway so it was “basically skipping a step”. I was preparing to buy a house of my own at that time but having to purchase hers prevented me from taking advantage of the market and I was finally able to purchase my own last year. 

Lately she’s been pressuring me to transfer the deed into the living trust she has because my older brother is about to have his first baby later this year. I’m uncomfortable with not having control over the property while still being on the hook for the mortgage/property taxes. She pays the mortgage for the house right now but I’m uncomfortable because she’s hinted in the past that when her husband dies I may need to take over the payments and she has a history of making bad financial decisions (I.e. spent my entire college fund her and my dad set up for me as a baby on real estate and lost it all in the 2008 U.S. recession, spent thousands out of my business account without asking/telling me before I was able to lock her out).

She initially asked me to do this last year but when I told her my concerns she agreed and said we wouldn’t. Now that the baby is becoming a reality she is insisting this needs to be updated in her trust and is saying that I won’t be held liable if they default on the mortgage because she has title insurance. She is also saying this needs to happen NOW because updating her trust costs $30k?? 

I feel like she’s gaslighting me because I was under the impression title insurance doesn’t protect you in any way when it comes to defaulting on mortgage. I also don’t think updating a few lines in your trust would cost that much. She’s pulling out other reasons like me having gotten married recently but that house is under a prenup so I don’t think it’s relevant. The main thing she is falling back on the deed needs to be in the trust to protect me and to allocate part of the assets to the new baby. 

Can anyone tell me if that’s a feature title insurance has that I don’t know about? Or if having the house in a living trust even though it’s already under my name would actually be beneficial? 

Any feedback would be helpful. I don’t think what she is saying is accurate but am totally open to the idea that I’m just ignorant.","[150.0, 30.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/178fmow/am_i_being_manipulated_into_signing_away/

My wife and I are in the process of getting our finances straightened out with a debt snowball. We have typically leased vehicles in the past, but we are trying to get to where we own our vehicles so we can be done with monthly payments. Part of that is no longer leasing vehicles, which we already did with my truck and now want to do with her Kia so we can pay them off in the next couple years, along with some student loans and things. 

So here’s the specifics: her Kia lease has a bit over a year left, but I am trying to determine if getting out of the lease as soon as possible makes more sense vs. riding it to the end and then purchasing her a car. We already know we don’t want to buy the Kia after the lease. It’s possible the dealer will buy out her lease early (since used car prices are still relatively high) and we walk away clean, maybe $500-$1000 if we’re lucky. We would then purchase a car (with a loan) to pay off and then hold on to long term. The other option is we wait, ride out our lease and turn it in, and then purchase the replacement at the end. Which option makes the most sense? What would you do? 

Thanks for any help or insight! I’ll answer any questions if more information could be helpful.

I stopped using it completely when they started hitting everything useful about it and turning it into basically a gift card shop.

Well I went on vacation to Japan and because of the time zone I confused myself and missed 1 payment. It was only last 2 days and I paid it as soon as I got my wife about me. And in just 2 days they shut my account down and dropped my spend power from $2500 all the way down to $50 🤡🤡🤡

Fuck these bozos their dying service .... They don't even care that I've been loyal for 6 years never missing a payment ever until now on a honest mistake and they told me there was a 10 day grace period... Only for the late fee ...what a joke. I'll pay them the one order I have and finally let this go since this service has lost all appeal and that fancy new program they hyped never came..

edit 11/19 I received alot of messages about contacting them and they will help so I did. I went through chat and after 2 hours of back and forth s I finally convinced them to have someone call me. we spoke on the phone and they praised me for my long tenure and said they would remove the late payment and restore my spending power. that was 11/17.. it's now 11/19 and I'm still at 0 and when I contacted support about my account still being 0 they said there is no guarantee they will restore my previous balance since it's a case by case basis completely reneging everything the lady on the phone told me.... what a crock of BS.... I'm dumbfounded right now by this

  
Edit 11/21 my balance is still zero I took another advice of the people and emailed them yesterday and explained everything about the missed payment, and what the lady on the phone promised me and how my account is current , all orders are paid but I still have a 0 balance. And the response I got was another AI generated word vomit about the grace period and how afterpay reviews accounts constantly and my spend power is determined on many ket factors and having a good payment history will increase my spending limit.

Despite the low wage, I'm still a mostly reliable afterpay customer who does prioritize paying off my orders every single week. But this last week was the first time I fell behind in over a year and a half  that I've been with afterpay with a limit reaching over $1000. I missed on time payments on three orders and had no other choice. I delayed as many orders as I could but it capped me after a few delays. 

As goes the story, my limit dropped to zero. I've been using the contact support messaging in app to reach out to support multiple times over my hardship and status. My paycheck just came in this Wednesday and I was able to instantly pay off the overdue orders and the currently due as well.

I understand that as a business Afterpay takes great risks. But it's treatment of customers and our lines of credit is poor to terrible. Late payments should not result in penalties for any customer who has proved their loyalty and almost always otherwise is on the ball with payments, our loyalty and service should mean more to this company because otherwise they would not exist if it weren't for the demand and loyalty of regular customers. 

So, dear Afterpay. Stop severe penalties for customers with occasional late payments. Stop dropping our limits down to zero. These aren't just difficult times for your management and networth of 1.8 billion dollar CEO Anthony Eisen, financially your workers and customers are probably under a great deal of financial strain due to corporate price gouging and the modern economic drudge. 

Also, full sympathy and support to customer service workers, y'all do hard work and deserve more respect for it, but y'all need a phone number where it is easy to reach the company. The lack of easy contact is extremely difficult, especially when our limits drop to zero and it takes multiple days on end to hear back from support. That's ridiculous.

I opened a dispute with AfterPay and continued making my payments while the dispute was handled. TEMU responded once again providing that image, and then providing an invoice that showed a shipping address that wasn't even mine and definitely did NOT match the one on the order!

I pointed this out in my response, and a week later AfterPay closed the dispute and sided with TEMU, saying they aren't responsible for PACKAGES THAT ARE STOLEN.

October 1,2023 I created my first afterpay account and like most of us was pre approved for $600, I was not able to get approved for my 1st order until December 21st,2023 which was for $120 at Sephora and I had to pay that off before being able to complete another order ( I was not able to spend the whole $600 ) after successfully paying that order off on time I was then able to make multiple orders until I exhausted the $600, fast forward to May 2024 I missed one payment due to my card being locked, paid it same day then boom next day my limit was decreased to $50 ( yes I was hurt ) if this happens to you NO THERE IS NOTHING AFTERPAY CAN DO ABOUT IT, writing customer service is pointless as they have no control over your spending limit.. it is now December of 2024 and my limit has not went back up even after staying active, spending the $50 and paying back on time! My advice to anyone who loves afterpay and want to keep their spending limit, PAY THEM ON TIME, make sure your card is never locked it does not matter if u are one minute late if they go to take their money and they can't it will count as a missed payment! Take advantage of rescheduling your payment I believe u can reschedule up to 3 times and even if u use them all COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND THEY WILL RESCHEDULE FOR YOU! Afterpay DOES NOT PLAY!

I stopped using it completely when they started hitting everything useful about it and turning it into basically a gift card shop.

Well I went on vacation to Japan and because of the time zone I confused myself and missed 1 payment. It was only last 2 days and I paid it as soon as I got my wife about me. And in just 2 days they shut my account down and dropped my spend power from $2500 all the way down to $50 🤡🤡🤡

Fuck these bozos their dying service .... They don't even care that I've been loyal for 6 years never missing a payment ever until now on a honest mistake and they told me there was a 10 day grace period... Only for the late fee ...what a joke. I'll pay them the one order I have and finally let this go since this service has lost all appeal and that fancy new program they hyped never came..

edit 11/19 I received alot of messages about contacting them and they will help so I did. I went through chat and after 2 hours of back and forth s I finally convinced them to have someone call me. we spoke on the phone and they praised me for my long tenure and said they would remove the late payment and restore my spending power. that was 11/17.. it's now 11/19 and I'm still at 0 and when I contacted support about my account still being 0 they said there is no guarantee they will restore my previous balance since it's a case by case basis completely reneging everything the lady on the phone told me.... what a crock of BS.... I'm dumbfounded right now by this

  
Edit 11/21 my balance is still zero I took another advice of the people and emailed them yesterday and explained everything about the missed payment, and what the lady on the phone promised me and how my account is current , all orders are paid but I still have a 0 balance. And the response I got was another AI generated word vomit about the grace period and how afterpay reviews accounts constantly and my spend power is determined on many ket factors and having a good payment history will increase my spending limit. Blah blah....and did not help me at all. I started another chat and got someone to call me and I just closed my account. This was exhausting and I'll never use this service again. It saved my ass so many times and it was so clutch but this current form is just useless in the US compared to what it was so while it sucks that I had to do this it's one less headache.

t5_3ka7d,Chargeback Retaliation,"Chargeback Retaliation Edit for clarity: I bought an item on AliExpress using Afterpay but realized I had chosen the wrong color. So, I canceled the order on AliExpress and then made sure it was also canceled on Afterpay. However, after a few days, I still hadn’t received my refund.

When I contacted Afterpay, they claimed they had refunded $8.33 (even though I had only paid $8.30). I waited 11 days, but the refund never appeared in my Chime account, which usually highlights incoming transactions in green. I saw neither the $8.30 I originally paid nor the $8.33 Afterpay claimed to have refunded. I then reached out to my bank, and they confirmed that no refund had been issued from Afterpay.

Eventually, I got approved for a dispute. Later, while managing my dropshipping business, I received an order and went to purchase the product on AliExpress using Afterpay. That’s when I noticed that, despite Afterpay’s claim of having no interest fees, interest was being applied to my orders. I brushed it off and proceeded with the purchase—only for Afterpay to deny the transaction.

I contacted their customer service first via email and then through chat. In their email response, they requested extra proof that I was the account holder, even though I had contacted them from the linked email. I provided the requested information, but after that—silence. A few hours later, I tried their chat support again, finally managed to get past the bot, and got my issue escalated to a human representative. But now, it’s been about four hours, and I still haven’t received a response.

At this point, I have a feeling they’re upset they couldn’t keep the money I had already paid. On top of that, I’ve also noticed that both Klarna and PayPal are charging me interest, even though I’ve never used them before. Now I’m wondering—is this an issue with Afterpay, AliExpress, or both?


Excuse my post if it's not making any sense of extremely annoyed because this is impeding on my business over what feels like a literal petty issue.

Edit: Example: I bought the item on the 02/22/2025 at 11pm canceled the order at 11:30pm 02/22/2025. Talked to customer service about the refund on 02/24/2025. They claimed in the email it was sent (and on the app) it was sent at 02/23/2025 at 1:30pm. With a note that said it could take up to 10 days. I wait till the 03/04/2025 nothing shows up in my bank account. I contact customer service about it again on the same day. more claims they refunded me this money. I then call my bank account to see if anything was pending. They noticed nothing was pending and that a refund should have been sent already. They push forward with a dispute. I provide them the email i was sent along with screenshot of the refund order claim on the app. The dispute gets filed and approved 3 days later.","[8.33, 8.3, 8.3, 8.33]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Afterpay/comments/1j7j8kv/chargeback_retaliation/

t5_3ka7d,Refund,"Refund Hi, 

I would usually never make a post for something so silly - however, I need someone to explain this to me in a way that makes sense, I promise I am not stupid - I am just having a hard time with the representatives at afterpay and they seem to be confused and don't want to help either. 

First, I made two purchases from Aerie and I used afterpay for both orders:

**1. The first order is in the total amount of $128.94**

\- For this order, I returned 2/4 items

\- So far, I have paid afterpay $64.48

\- I owe afterpay $64.46 still. 

**2. The second order is in the total amount of $87.75**

\- For this order, I returned 4/4 items

\- So far, I have paid afterpay $43.88

\- I should owe $43.87, because I was refunded the total amount of $87.75, rather than refunded the amount I had paid to afterpay. 

When I went to Aerie to complete the return, they returned everything as one order, rather than 2. This caused some confusion on afterpays end and they ended up pausing the refund because they couldn't find the order it belonged to. 

Aerie refunded me $152.21. This would be the **$87.75** and the **$64.48** together for the two returns. However, I would still owe afterpay for the remaining balance of the first order, as I kept two of the items. This would be $64.46. 

I am confused because I paid a total of $108.36 to afterpay for the two orders that were RETURNED. Afterpay wants me to continue to pay the balance for both orders. This would leave me with a refund balance of $43.85, which is not what I paid in total to afterpay for things I returned. Am I not understanding this correctly? I have made multiple returns with Klarna and I have NEVER had something like this happen - they refund the money I paid to them and then adjust the balance, if need be. 

The difference between the $108.36 and the amount I was refunded is exactly $43.85, which is what I should owe for the second order because it was refunded completely. However, for the first order, since I paid $64.48 and returned 2 of the items, shouldn't I keep what I paid? 

I'm literally not understanding why I would be left with $43.85 because for that first order I returned 2/4 items, so part of that refund should include the two items returned from the first order. 

Please help!! This is so confusing and no one seems to understand either.

t5_3ka7d,Afterpay spending limit decrease!,"Afterpay spending limit decrease! I am writing this for anyone who is going through the same thing I'm going through with after pay at this moment and that's wondering when your spending limit will increase after being decreased due to late payments so!

October 1,2023 I created my first afterpay account and like most of us was pre approved for $600, I was not able to get approved for my 1st order until December 21st,2023 which was for $120 at Sephora and I had to pay that off before being able to complete another order ( I was not able to spend the whole $600 ) after successfully paying that order off on time I was then able to make multiple orders until I exhausted the $600, fast forward to May 2024 I missed one payment due to my card being locked, paid it same day then boom next day my limit was decreased to $50 ( yes I was hurt ) if this happens to you NO THERE IS NOTHING AFTERPAY CAN DO ABOUT IT, writing customer service is pointless as they have no control over your spending limit.. it is now December of 2024 and my limit has not went back up even after staying active, spending the $50 and paying back on time! My advice to anyone who loves afterpay and want to keep their spending limit, PAY THEM ON TIME, make sure your card is never locked it does not matter if u are one minute late if they go to take their money and they can't it will count as a missed payment! Take advantage of rescheduling your payment I believe u can reschedule up to 3 times and even if u use them all COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND THEY WILL RESCHEDULE FOR YOU! Afterpay DOES NOT PLAY! It is hard getting your spending limit back up once they decrease it, it's been 7 months for me and still $50.

t5_3ka7d,Insane drop in pre-approved spending,"Insane drop in pre-approved spending I'm heavily considering letting go of Afterpay after an insane drop in my pre-approved to spend. I have been a faithful customer of Afterpay for a little over a year now. I mainly use it for Amazon, Shein, and occasionally Temu. I had a little over 1,000 in pre-approved spending built up and I always paid my balances before their due dates. Afterpay tried to charge my card and my bank sent back the payment (I had fraudulent charges which led them to do this). I work overnight and didn't see the notifications on my phone in order to pay it until the following morning, at which time I paid it and one of my other payments that falls within the dates that I usually pay altogether. My pre-approved is now $50! I think it's insane that something so small as 1 missed payment that was resolved in 24hrs resulted in more than $1,000 being taken away from my pre-approved spending.  

It's important to note that the same situation happened with Klarna (who I've been using for about 3 months now), I paid within the same amount of time as Afterpay and my purchase power went from $500 to $300...

Has anyone else experienced this or think I'm overreacting?

Then I made some early payments at Klarna and CACHING! Another $10 GC earned from the app.

All while earning cashback on my CC which I will, of course, pay off.

No late payments in 2023. $1500 spending limit. 

Afterpay is EASILY my favorite spending app. That being said, I recently had an emergency that put me out 1 full paycheck. Not OUT to where I was incapable of making my agreed upon payments, but enough to make me uncomfortable. Klarna, Sezzle- they allow you to move your payments down a cycle for some breathing room for situations just like this, so long as you've never done so with an open order before. I was hoping to do the same with Afterpay, but read you can only move payments 3 times a year and didnt want to 'waste' them... I contacted support, since that's what the help section told me to do, and it snowballed to them blocking my account?!?

Has anyone had this happen to them before? Is there a way to come back from it? I'm so stressed. This was one of my saviors during the holidays.  I genuinely do not understand how our wires got crossed,  but they did. 

Will add the entire convo in photos. 

The big $350 'Disney' charge mentioned was a  canceled order, confirmed by both Afterpay and Disney, that was due to drop off.... which realistically leaves me with a ≈$300 balance, which I absolutely would've paid off if I knew **this** would happen. 


I'm devastated honestly. I worked hard to get where I am (started 2023 with a $50 limit) and I just... ugh. I'm hoping someone can give me advice.

t5_3ka7d,The logic of Afterpay is incredible.,"The logic of Afterpay is incredible. I joined Afterpay a few months back. I initially was hesitant to use the service but found it to be quite convenient but recently, have started to question how Afterpay makes its decisions on what gets approved and what doesn't. 

A few weeks ago, I decided to use Afterpay at Duluth Trading Company to get a couple new pairs of work pants. I successfully used it for a purchase of around $150. No issues.

Then very next day, I went to DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse) and bought two pairs of shoes, one for myself and one for the wife, totalling around $135, using Afterpay, and was successful. 

I paid the initial payments, $38.10 at Duluth and $33.59 at DSW. The very next week I paid both off, just deciding to get it done with. Total was around $285 or so all together after all payments, no big deal, felt great to just get it paid.

I then decided I'd use it this week to buy a Switch for my wife on the Afterpay app in Target ($299), order it online and go pick it up in store, no problem. Go in, click the Afterpay icon, submit purchase and.. denied? That's interesting. 

No missed payment, pre-approval for $1000, all orders paid off ahead of time, all green on my end. Read that it could be the order amount was too much, which seems highly illogical, as I previously stated, I had two open orders totalling $286 and the Switch was $299.. so almost the same amount. Why does it make sense to approve to orders for $286 but not one for $299? 

I don't know, maybe I'm expecting too much from Afterpay? I simply figured, as long as I paid off orders, never miss a payment, and was an overall good customer, I'd be treated fairly. 

Seems so very strange to be denied a purchase when I could literally drive to Target and buy the damn thing without Afterpay (which is what I'm gonna do). Why even give pre-approval spending limits like a credit card does when people actually can't use it? 

Imagine getting a credit card limit of $5000 and when you go to spend $1500 on a purchase the card company goes ""Well we did pre-approve you for way more but ya know, that's really more of a ballpark figure, so you're just out of luck, maybe just spend like $50 and that's all, ok?"" 

Hell, Afterpay doesn't even take that risk as they make you pay one installment right away! At least they get money from you immediately, unlike a credit card, which essentially works on the honor system. 

Anyways, that's my rant. 

I think Afterpay is a convenient tool to use, especially when you have the funds for something but want to pay them back in small chunks.. but the ambiguity surrounding the ""pre-approval"" amount and what constitutes a purchase being ""too much"" is a big let down and has me considering closing down my account.","[150.0, 135.0, 38.1, 33.59, 285.0, 299.0, 1000.0, 286.0, 299.0, 286.0, 299.0, 5000.0, 1500.0, 50.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Afterpay/comments/pywz96/the_logic_of_afterpay_is_incredible/

You have go through the whole check out process only to potentially find out you can't actually afford the item. When it used to tell you upfront. Another thing I've found is if you do this often enough and not go through with orders all because you just wanted to see if you could actually afford it because they don't show you the installment amount upfront anymore it can actually affect your spending balance.

First time poster here, long time user.

I just logged into my account to see if they had any news on the new credit laws for BNPL schemes within Australia.

I noticed my limit had increased from $2000 to $2500 which has taken literally forever, I have lost my mint access though. It's crazy how the dopamine hits when you see a higher limit, but you also always think, do I need whatever it is you are contemplating purchasing. 

However in saying that, if and when they do implement the credit checks in order to use the service, if it were to affect existing users, I personally would still using the service just for the sake of keeping my current credit history in good standing. 

Like others have said in other posts, unfortunately  the acts or lack of action of a few people are the reason why they have decided to introduce these new laws, because I honestly see Afterpay as a laybuy service, or just the ideal scenario that you are able to spread out your payments to align with your paycheck, it's convenient. I do also get that, there are also those out there who like to exploit the service by seeing it as free money and never intending to make repayments. 

For those in Australia, what are your thoughts? 

Two questions to ponder over:

1. Would you continue to use the service if it impacted your credit history and hard enquiries were made on your report?

2. What's your biggest purchase on the platform so far?

Like anyone else my goal was to save money so I went onto ebay.com through the Afterpay app to buy second hand but also still have small payments. I clicked !!!FREE SHIPPING!!! on the eBay site and it pulled in many results. However every time I clicked one of the listings a fairly large shipping cost would appear. Anywhere from $7-$30 on some. Weird right? I thought my app was glitching so I went onto the eBay app + safari and put in the same search with the same free shipping filter. To my surprise the !!!SAME EXACT!!! $30 shipping shirts were listed under the same sellers with free shipping. I went through about 10-15 of the same listings and compared them with eBay.com direct and EBay.com through the Afterpay app, and !!!AFTERPAY HAD FALSE SHIPPING COSTS!!! on the listings.

t5_3ka7d,Account way charged full amount,"Account way charged full amount Hi! I used Afterpay this morning to finish up some Christmas shopping. Total was a little over $200 and my limit is $800. I pressed “buy now, pay later” and it never ended up showing on my Afterpay account - my limit is still $800 and nothing shows up in my orders. I kept checking my actual bank account to make sure that Afterpay even worked and no transactions were there either but the order was placed on my Amazon account. I checked my regular bank account a few hours later and I was charged the full amount from Amazon but I also have transactions for zero dollars from Afterpay. 

Is this going to resolve itself or did I luck out on Afterpay this time? I’m not sure if I should cancel my order because it’s been quite a few hours now since placed, I don’t know if it’s worth waiting for a refund and trying again.

t5_3ka7d,Why do ppl use so much ,Why do ppl use so much  I have afterpay. I've had it for a year.... started at 500 now at 2500. Highest I've ever went with after pay was 1300 because I bought a phone from best buy. Other than that if I use after pay I use it maybe once a month or for emergency purposes like maybe groceries or household items. But I see ppl use almost thier whole limit. I try to stay under $200 for anything because of those big weekly payments. I kinda miss when apple had an after pay. It was every 4 weeks and much easier to let them know you needed an extra week or two for the next payment. But anyway... my question is why do some of you guys use up so much of your limit? It's like a credit card that don't go on your credit. You gotta know your limits or you can put yourself in a hole. I was able to go from 500 to 2500 in a year just spending under $200 every so often.

t5_3ka7d,Chargeback Retaliation,"Chargeback Retaliation Edit for clarity: I bought an item on AliExpress using Afterpay but realized I had chosen the wrong color. So, I canceled the order on AliExpress and then made sure it was also canceled on Afterpay. However, after a few days, I still hadn’t received my refund.

When I contacted Afterpay, they claimed they had refunded $8.33 (even though I had only paid $8.30). I waited 11 days, but the refund never appeared in my Chime account, which usually highlights incoming transactions in green. I saw neither the $8.30 I originally paid nor the $8.33 Afterpay claimed to have refunded. I then reached out to my bank, and they confirmed that no refund had been issued from Afterpay.

Eventually, I got approved for a dispute. Later, while managing my dropshipping business, I received an order and went to purchase the product on AliExpress using Afterpay. That’s when I noticed that, despite Afterpay’s claim of having no interest fees, interest was being applied to my orders. I brushed it off and proceeded with the purchase—only for Afterpay to deny the transaction.

I contacted their customer service first via email and then through chat. In their email response, they requested extra proof that I was the account holder, even though I had contacted them from the linked email. I provided the requested information, but after that—silence. A few hours later, I tried their chat support again, finally managed to get past the bot, and got my issue escalated to a human representative. But now, it’s been about four hours, and I still haven’t received a response.

At this point, I have a feeling they’re upset they couldn’t keep the money I had already paid. On top of that, I’ve also noticed that both Klarna and PayPal are charging me interest, even though I’ve never used them before. Now I’m wondering—is this an issue with Afterpay, AliExpress, or both?


Excuse my post if it's not making any sense of extremely annoyed because this is impeding on my business over what feels like a literal petty issue.

Edit: Example: I bought the item on the 02/22/2025 at 11pm canceled the order at 11:30pm 02/22/2025. Talked to customer service about the refund on 02/24/2025. They claimed in the email it was sent (and on the app) it was sent at 02/23/2025 at 1:30pm. With a note that said it could take up to 10 days. I wait till the 03/04/2025 nothing shows up in my bank account. I contact customer service about it again on the same day. more claims they refunded me this money. I then call my bank account to see if anything was pending. They noticed nothing was pending and that a refund should have been sent already. They push forward with a dispute. I provide them the email i was sent along with screenshot of the refund order claim on the app. The dispute gets filed and approved 3 days later.","[8.33, 8.3, 8.3, 8.33]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Afterpay/comments/1j7j8kv/chargeback_retaliation/

Since I started Afterpay I was given $250 to spend in January 2024. Month after Month it went up now being December I am now able to spend $1500.

Now I am not a huge spender. The only reason I am actually using Afterpay is digital steam or google gift cards. Give or take between $25-$50 each month. I have never missed a payment and never did a refund. If anything I would assume that my account is in perfect standing.

Now I never buy more than 1 gift card. I buy 1 pay it out then buy another so in total this year I bought 11 with no issues, no delinquency and no refund.

I completed my November payment a few days ago, So now I am attempting to buy another but was declined. I tried to do $50 google play credit but was decline that it was a ""restricted"" item, even though it shows up on the mobile app of listed things I can buy.

I contacted Afterpay and their useless AI Bot was giving me a generic response which was something about delinquency and again I have none. I got in touch with an agent which also told me that I did not have any delinquency.

So why am I suddenly now restricted from purchasing gift cards when it has been ok the last 11 months?

So they dropped me down to $0 and once I paid off all my purchases, I know have a $50 limit and none of the perks I had. I’m back to the lowest level customer. Pretty upsetting because I often use Afterpay for necessities that I can’t afford to pay for all at once.

t5_3ka7d,Maybe I’m not understanding amounts adjustment,"Maybe I’m not understanding amounts adjustment OK so I’ve been with Afterpay for a little over a year. When I’m doing online purchases and it asks you how much the order is I normally put in the exact amount but every once in a while, I might add in a little extra for Walmart when I’m doing groceries old me I only recently started doing that. 

I placed an order for Walmart. I made the total $75. (So from previous experience when you do this and the final total  ends up being less afterpay, ends up adjusting the amount of the order automatically and then adjust your payments accordingly.) now for whatever reason that did not happen with this order, a Walmart fully refunded me for this order it which totaled $69.66 I have to pay it still wants to charge me $3.71. I have reached out to them and said hey, what’s going on like this should be zeroed out I have sent you screenshots of everything I’m not sure why you’re still trying to charge me $3.71. My order did not end up being $75. I did not use $75. I only used to $69.66 so this order should’ve been adjusted accordingly just like it tells you when you’re putting in the amount, it tells you that it’s going to do that if need be and they’re telling me no I still owe them $3.71 because the order $75 and I’m like no it’s not you  of the order it’s $69.66 now I know it’s only $3.71 but still why am I going to pay them $3.71 When literally I did not buy anything for that I bought $69.66 which was refunded back to Afterpay. I didn’t buy anything for $75 so that 3.71 is gone. There is no 3.71 because the order was never $75. I don’t know maybe I’m just not understanding something maybe I’m tired and usually I am the one on top of this telling people what’s up about refunds but I don’t know. Also, I’m using voice to text so if something doesn’t make sense sorry ahead of time. when I confronted them this and sent them screenshots of everything and the receipts of the emails from Walmart showing the purchase and then the refund they stop replying back to me when I asked them why are you trying to charge me more than what the order cost they decided they weren’t going to talk to me anymore. They stop messaging me for it’s been like three days. All the sudden they went cold turkey. So then I went to Facebook. I went to Twitter and they were talking to me but then they tried to tell me I still owe them that 3.71 so they’re trying to charge me for more than what my order was again I sent them the receipts, the copies of everything then they stop talking to me again they don’t wanna talk to me no more when I said, why are you trying to charge me for more than what my order is and sent them screenshots of everything and then they stop talking to me. They didn’t talk to me no more. It’s just like I’ll probably at this point let it go for $3.71 but then it makes you think how many times I’ve done this do I need to go back and check all of my orders and then now maybe do I not let this go because it adds up how many bigger orders have I done that they may be to have they done this before and I just wasn’t paying attention has happened to anybody else usually I’m on pretty good terms with Afterpay but now I’m just like what in the world is happening here","[75.0, 69.66, 3.71, 3.71, 75.0, 75.0, 69.66, 3.71, 75.0, 69.66, 3.71, 3.71, 69.66, 75.0, 75.0, 3.71]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Afterpay/comments/1759qfe/maybe_im_not_understanding_amounts_adjustment/

I do a lot of over-time to compensate, for the money I do spend and I only budget my self off my base income not my overtime. 

I’ve used afterpay incorrectly in the past. When i was flating/student. I found it super helpful back then, especially buying stuff off mighty ape and racking extreme snack bills during Covid, I did buy the odd car service kit with it. Spark plugs etc. 

But now I’m kinda using it a bit more useful, like when my partners car it needed an emergency fix. I had the cash on me and could’ve paid right away, but it would’ve interfered with the current plan. 
I also started a little side hustle, pulling apart cars and selling the parts. Im doing that and used it as a credit free loan to get tools to start doing that.

t5_2qstm,Is Afterpay okay?,"Is Afterpay okay? I tend to use my credit cards for everyday purchases like groceries, especially because groceries are the main way I rack up points. However, when I buy clothes online I like to use Afterpay when I can because I can budget my clothing spending out really easily and it just automatically puts into perspective for me that if I really want a certain item of clothing I'll be paying $40 every 2 weeks for example. 

It's also no interest and I don't miss payments even accidentally because it just automatically takes it from my account. I go grocery shopping on a pretty regular schedule so I usually remember to pay the balance after but for online shopping it's pretty irregular so I'm kind of willing to deal with the fact that Afterpay doesn't build credit in exchange for the convenience of it. 

I find it weirdly mentally helpful to buy myself a really nice item of clothing I've been wanting and then have that reminder that's like ""yeah you really wanted this but you are still paying it off for four more weeks!"" and it makes me less likely to impulse buy because I think ""oh but there's still two more payments on the last thing I bought.."" Even if I can always comfortably pay for it outright Afterpay is like forced accountability for me because I have to think about whether or not the item is worth taking like a month to pay off... but I don't want to do that on a credit card with interest.

i accidentally sent money to the wrong person for one of those purchases and in getting that money back, paypal cleared my balance. so i spent some more of it until paypal took what i had spent prior to it being wiped, added what i had spent after it being wiped together and gave me $2,600 in debt. now it’s up to $3,666 and i have a payment of $430 due. i haven’t paid it because i have not made enough money at one given time to be able to pay that. that’s what i make in a decent month. i’ve been hoping it would be sent to collections so i can negotiate it but it’s been nearly a year and so far nothing. i have had a lot of money stolen by/through paypal before so my bank account no longer allows me to make payments through paypal, so i can’t pay this off if i wanted to. 

i am beyond in over my head with this debt. i am completely overwhelmed and have a panic attack every time i check paypal. i cannot get approved for another credit card, affirm, klarna, afterpay even for emergencies. i attempted to take out an emergency loan for a personal issue and it was denied because of this credit card. i have another credit card that i make all payments on on time/early, i barely even use it but my credit score is still horrific (460😬) because of this card.

t5_2qstm,Loan/debt advice AUSTRALIA ,"Loan/debt advice AUSTRALIA  (Long story short, been screwed by my employer recently and can't afford to pay rent let alone any other bills!)

I have been kicked out of home about 3 months ago and spent a full 2 months homeless while paying $125 a week for loans/phone payments

Was making about $700 a week at my first job and another $300 a week on my second (after tax)

About a month ago I finally got my own place and my work has been fully aware of my living situation, the only reason why I got my place is due to them telling the real-estate that they guarantee my income... My rent is $460 a week and I have 2 other people moving in with me soon to pay rent (in a month or 2)

I had to pull out another loan for emergencies which I may not talk about and in total my debts are;

-$10000 personal
-$7000 vehicle
-$2100 afterpay

My work has decided they don't wish to pay me for my services and have cut my hours by about 25 a week leaving me with $455 after tax, my loan repayment is $115 a week and my after current is $500 for the next 2 weeks, after that they are $200 or less

I am left with nothing after each payday and having to rely on my partner to help me with my payments??? How screwed is that

I don't have the vehicle anymore and require one for my second job now, I only just got out of being in a tough situation and feel as I am back in another one!!

t5_2qstm,Does PayPal affect my credit score long term?,"Does PayPal affect my credit score long term? So I just had a bit of an argument with my (20f) mom (47f). We got on the topic of money and my mother is a saleswoman, and has always just generally had a general belief that spending money that isn't yours is just a bad idea in general, which I agree with. She uses nothing but her debit card and cash when purchasing things. She's never even signed up for a credit card once in her life or ever taken out a loan that wasn't a mortgage or student loans. 

She's *very* persistent about these things, and honestly, I agree with her 99% of the time. I've never taken a loan (except student loans ofc), I rarely ever borrow money from friends even, and only once in my life have I ever used anything like AfterPay (it was once, I never missed a payment, but I didn't like it and unless I'm in a desperate emergency I highly doubt I'll ever use it again). I'm not really interested in a credit card ever, though I've learnt plenty online on how to use one to build up your credit score so maybe way down the future I might consider getting one. 

Now, where the argument comes in. The one thing I do use, however, is PayPal when I shop online. I got it first when I was 16 when my bank wouldn't allow me to get even a debit card at the time and all I use it for ever since then is merely use it as ""middleman"" of sorts. Now that I do have a debit card I don't want to give my information out to different websites, only on platforms I trust and for whatever reason PayPal isn't an option. So I prefer using PayPal; I have it connected to my bank account and when I want to buy things online I pay through that. It simply serves as the bridge between my money and whatever online shop I use it on; I've never used credit, I have never used the ""Bill Me Later"" option. I use nothing but my own money when I use it. Only once in my life have I ever gotten a negative balance on PayPal (only $40), but that was due to some error on PayPal's part for disconnecting my bank account for some reason. Once I called support and got it sorted, it was fine again.

I basically use it the same way as a person would with a debit card. I prefer using PayPal because if a site doesn't offer it as a payment option, except Amazon, I'm less likely to trust it, and my mom has only proven this point to me in the past by getting scammed online and having to close her old card and get a new one. If on the off chance I do get scammed online, as it did happen once, I feel more comfortable knowing I paid with PayPal because then I can get my money back by opening a dispute. 99% of my refunds go directly back to my bank account anyway, I can count on my hand the times money staying within my PayPal balance. Most of the times I just move it back to my bank account if it happens. 

The reason the argument happened was because, off hand I mentioned I use PayPal when I shop online, and I use it to pay my phone and internet bill. I like using it. I recommend to my friends to use it the way I do. She went absolutely *spastic* on me, telling me to close my account, that it's awful to use, that it will affect my credit score and that if maybe I stop *now* I might be fine when I'm 25. When I asked her to explain how it's bad she kept lumping it in with services like AfterPay, zipPay, credit cards, etc---things I understand how they can be bad, but when I asked her why specifically PayPal is awful, she'd just tell me I'm naive and ""it just is!"" and would go on about how it appears bad to banks and so on. I ignored her and did some of my own research; it could be bad if you use PayPal credit. It could be bad if you use the Bill Me Later option. They can check your credit score if you have a Premium or Business account, or that if you owe money to PayPal (such as the negative balance) it could come across as a debt eventually. I'm starting to think she just confused it with the PayPal Credit thing, because I couldn't find *anything* on how it could affect a person's credit score if they use PayPal simply as a transaction tool as I do. 

But I'm no expert, so that's why I'm asking reddit. Can PayPal affect your credit score in the long term if you simply use it as a transaction tool like a debit card?",[40.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/gx4psq/does_paypal_affect_my_credit_score_long_term/
t5_2qstm,"Rent is Most of My Income, but I'm in College","Rent is Most of My Income, but I'm in College Hi!

I've (20F) been a long time lurker on this sub and I've learned a lot about budgeting and finances. I'm a sophomore in college and recently (in August) moved into a flat with 3 other roommates. We live downtown in a major city where we all go to college.

I work about 15-20 hours (usually 20) a week at $10 an hour. I really love my job, I work at a doggy daycare and have been there for about a year, it's somewhere I'm able to go and have fun for part of the day. $60 every paycheck get directly pulled out of my paycheck and go straight to paying my student loan, which I believe is more than the minimum. My rent is $510 a month per person, which is cheap compared to other living situations around here. Most people who pay similar rent are sharing a room. We're lucky enough to all have our own, decent sized rooms.

I started using YNAB a couple months ago and have been tracking my expenses, but sometimes find it hard to stay within my budget. The way I use it is I try to budget out this months needed expenses (rent (utilities included), internet, groceries, Afterpay bills, and my cat) as well as next months  needed expenses, before I allow myself to budget for things like beauty, alcohol, dining out.

I also have some savings going. I'm trying to reach that first $1000 in emergency fund, and I'm also putting money away for when I want to buy a car. I wouldn't buy one that I'd need to pay monthly. I was going to try to save around $3,000-$5,000 for an older, but good car, but at the rate I'm going it'll take me like 8 years. All my classes are online, and I usually bike to work (\~5 min) or walk (\~15 min). I plan on using the bus in the winter this year when it gets really harsh.

My question is this:

I don't work very much because I'm in school full time. I really believe if I were to pick up more hours, it might interfere with my grades. I already don't do too hot in school because of the workload, along with depression and anxiety that seem to find a way to mess up everything I do. I recently started taking anti-depressants and trying therapy to see how I can work with it, but it's not an immediate fix.

When I read about how much rent should be of your income, it's usually 30% of your income. Mine is roughly 90%. Almost all of the money I make goes into paying rent. I tried googling some tips on what to do if your rent is over 30% of your income, but most articles talk about your rent being 50% of your income, and mine is so much more than that. Could the money I'm making every week be better put towards something else? Should I pick up more hours and deal with low grades because of it? I was really excited to move out of my parent's house and start living like an independent, but my finances are stressing me out the point where I won't eat sometimes because I'm afraid to not have money for groceries and I don't know what to do. Having to move back with them would suck, and when classes turn back to being in-person, I'd have to commute to school and work, and would probably miss out on a lot of fun social activities that happen here.

I know I probably shouldn't be worrying much about money while I'm in college, and should be focusing on grades. (As what the information in the 18-20 section say) but I can't help but stress about it and don't know what to do.","[10.0, 60.0, 510.0, 1000.0, 3000.0, 5000.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/j3x5cc/rent_is_most_of_my_income_but_im_in_college/

Problem was, I purchased an item from an online retailer only to find out a week later that there was a ""problem processing my order"" and it never actually went through, so the online merchant apologized and issued a refund.

Quadpay still charged me for the purchase (plus convience fees they add to each installment payment) and debited my account. The original merchant told me that a full refund had been issued, but Quadpay never refunded me.

The company has no phone number and their ""email support"" link on the app only gets you an automated response every time you contact them.

I made the worse mistake of trusting them that my refund would go through and tried to purchase a gift on Amazon using Quadpay a second time.

Same thing happened. Amazon declined the ""Quadpay ghost card"" and charged my personal debit card instead. 

But Quadpay still took money out of my account and set me up for more installments to be withdrawn.

t5_2qstm,"Travelling around the country indefinitely, do I leave with debt or savings?","Travelling around the country indefinitely, do I leave with debt or savings? I'm going travelling around Australia next month for at least a year or longer with my partner. We currently have just over $7,000 AUD saved up, but roughly $2.5k in debt and will be expecting at least another $1k to come out for getting a car service, afterpay, etc. 



We'll have a steady income stream of roughly $700 a fortnight from student centrelink payments, and expect to get at least $4k (fingers crossed) before we leave from selling our cars, tax returns, selling other items, etc. The credit card debt has 55 days interest free on purchases and we've been paying it off gradually without being hit from interest due to staggering our purchases. 


In a nutshell, I'm wondering: is it better to pay the roughly $3.5k debt due now and leave with less savings but no debt? Or would it be better to leave with debt and more savings? The money coming in from student payments is pretty much guaranteed but the government here is quick to stop your payments suddenly if they don't think something is right. I've calculated that $12k would be sufficient for a year's travel, so $1k/month = $250/wk.

t5_2qstm,Assistance with savings,"Assistance with savings I apologise if this is the wrong thread. 

Long time lurker; first time posting. From Australia. :)

&#x200B;

Hello all, 

So, basically my dilemma is just wondering how I can properly budget to save and essentially be in a surplus each month. I guess I'll start with what payments I'm currently paying off that I'd like to pay before the end of the year:

iPhone XS Max (This is on Apple's 12 month interest-free program) I've already put down 500 dollars on the account \~ 1,299 left to pay. I'd like to pay this off before the end of the year so I'd start 2019 on a new slate if possible. 

In Australia, we have a service deemed AfterPay, basically where applicable, allows a consumer to pay off products over an 8 week period; fortnightly payments. (No interest is accumulated or added past 8 weeks, except for a late fee); I have a chair I purchased as my other one was just killing my back that I bought for $260. The first payment for $65 is due next week. 

I also had to build my own PC as mine was shitting itself so I used a service called ZipMoney that has 6 months interest-free on the purchase of my own custom parts. I currently have 285 dollars remaining and the interest-free period ends next year in February. Direct Debited from my account is $100 p/m.  

&#x200B;

Yes, quite a few needs paying off as I'm embarrassed to admit. 

&#x200B;

The only major payment I have is for my car which is around $1,000 p/m. I make around $2800-3200 per month. The car payments are fine, they're not killing me; I'm comfortably paying it. Insurance is around an extra $200 p/m.

&#x200B;

Due to few bad decisions with my spending habits, I'm now below 1k in savings. I do get paid in a few days which is the good part. 

&#x200B;

I'm not stressing over any payments that I currently have going on, just like to get tips on how to save and what to pay off first/quickly.

The seller I'm trying to buy from offers the Klarna option, so I clicked through the app to see what the offer would be.

For a purchase of $2700, it offered me a payment option of 24 or 48 months, at 0 -29.99% APR. When I clicked the 24 month option, it then switched to 0.00% APR. 

So the plan is: *24 payments of $112.08 at 0% APR.* 

*Order amount\* - $2,690.00*  
*Total interest (0.00% APR) - $0.00*  
*Total cost - $2,690.00*  
*Pay today -$0.00*

My question: what is the catch? Is it truly just 24 monthly payments of $112 at no interest? It seems too good to be true. Why would Klarna not be charging me interest? My credit score is like 760, so is that why?

How are Klarna and the actual retailer benefiting from this? Do they just bank on people not making payments? Or charging people with lower credit interest?

If anyone has experience with Klarna, it would be appreciated.","[2700.0, 2700.0, 112.08, 2690.0, 0.0, 2690.0, 0.0, 112.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15mojf8/making_a_purchase_via_klarna_but_it_is_telling_me/

But 4 payments of $120 every two weeks is a bit more manageable, it's still technically paying it in just over a month but I'd get two salaries in that time (my next one is in a few days) and it'd be a lot easier on my wallet.

I'm not worried about missing payments, I do have the money and especially when I get my salary I won't even need to touch my savings.

t5_2qstm,Could someone please help me? Consolidation Loan vs Snowball Method,"Could someone please help me? Consolidation Loan vs Snowball Method \*\*Might edit this as I start crunching numbers\*\*



I'm trying to figure out if it would be smart to take out a personal consolidation loan for my credit cards. I make just about **$2,800** a month after taxes, working **fulltime 7 days a week**. (I also donate plasma occasionally when my body can handle it, but it isn't a “reliable” income and I could get deferred at any time...)

I am currently a college student and will be starting an intense 15-month Nuclear Medicine program this fall. Due to MANDATORY 40-hours a week clinicals, this means at some point I will have to cut down my work hours and rely mostly on student loans to cover living expenses etc. The student loan debt is a sacrifice I am willing to make for my future, because Nuclear Medicine pay is quite literally 3-4x what I currently make at my entry-level job and I will be able to make bigger payments towards my debt. *I will still have a job while in the program, but I will be cutting down to PRN/part-time hours which means I will NOT be bringing home fulltime pay after around October of this year.* (This scares me a lot which is why I am in a panic to get my cards paid down before this fall so I have less payments per month to worry about.)

* A worry that I have is that due to my high credit card debt (my utilization is a very high %), I will not be able to be APPROVED for private student loans if I happened to need them.
* I am also scared that if I take out a consolidation loan NOW, I might not get approved for a private student loan if I happen to need one at some point. (My federal loans don't always cover my full tuition even when I take out the max amount.)

My FICO score is **622** so **I cannot get approved for a balance-transfer card. My credit card utilization is VERY HIGH as you will see below.**

I'm torn between a loan and paying it off quicker, or just continuing with the snowball method. (I 100% DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT CARDS ANYMORE AND WILL NOT BE USING THEM AGAIN AFTER PAYING THEM OFF.)

The loan I was pre-approved for is through Upgrade. $12,000.

* 5-year (60 months) loan: **$345.15**/month, **23.99%** interest rate, 29.35% APR (includes the one-time 9.99% origination fee)
* 3-year (36 months) loan: **$452.04**/month, **20.99%** interest rate, 28.90% APR (includes the one-time 9.99% origination fee)

Obviously I’m leaning towards the 36 month loan but the minimum payment is higher than what I currently pay for my minimums on my credit cards…. So am I stupid for even considering it? I can’t seem to get approved for any interest rates lower than 20%, but I’m hoping I might be able to refinance it sometime once my credit score improves.

TOTAL COSTS FOR DEBT+EXPENSES: **\~$2225** a month which leaves me with about $575 after everything is paid.

He paid us back on time, as promised but I assume he’s going to find himself in exactly the same position next payday. We’ll lend him the money again since it’s a small amount and we’re fortunate enough that we won’t be in any kind of trouble if he can’t actually pay us back for a while. As I write this, we might just tell him to pay us back in a few months once he’s got himself some breathing room… but that isn’t the point of this post…

Is anyone aware of any alternatives to payday loans? Our friend had previously got caught up in that cycle and estimates he paid around $2k in fees and interest over the course of about 8 months. All this for continually borrowing <$1k until payday for a week at a time or so.

It seems as though there’s got to be something between the 5% to 10% interest of a personal loan for those who are well qualified and the 400% for those stuck with payday loans. If there isn’t, there should be! There has to be a business model that would allow you to take risky bets and charge 25% interest or somewhere around there.

t5_2qstm,StubHub stole from me and I have no idea what to do,"StubHub stole from me and I have no idea what to do Hi all,

Wondering if this community has any ideas on how I can escalate this and get my money back. 

I bought tickets to an event on StubHub through Klarna (third party entity that allows you to make four installment payments). StubHub delivered the tickets electronically, but for reasons I don’t understand they wouldn’t open on my phone and StubHub couldn’t resolve the issue before the event, meaning I missed it. This was especially upsetting because the tickets were a Christmas gift. 

Initially StubHub refused to reimburse me, saying it was the fault of whatever entity sent the tickets that they wouldn’t open. As such, I opened a dispute with Klarna to get reimbursed through them. The same day, StubHub backtracked and said they could reimburse me if I dropped the case with Klarna. I did the same day. 

Now, it has been over a month since I dropped the case and I keep getting the runaround every time I call StubHub.  They say they can’t reimburse me while there is a chargeback attempt on the account. I told them I dropped the dispute. I have called and emailed dozens of times, only to be told to be patient and the relevant department is working on a resolution. After another two weeks of radio silence from them, I emailed asking for an update and was told they were trying to replace the tickets.  What in the world?! I just had a baby a week ago. I can’t go to any event even if they did replace the tickets AND I never requested that happen. I want a reimbursement. 

I called Klarna today to reopen the dispute and they told me there was nothing they could do because the dispute window closed. They advised me to try calling my bank. The problem is, the payments were made via direct withdrawal/debit, so effectively have no protections. 

What do I do? How is this legal? StubHub just keeps doing nothing. I’m out almost $400 and that is money we could really use to pay hospital bills now that the baby is here. 

I’ve certainly learned a lesson and will never use Klarna or StubHub again.",[400.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ap1qiv/stubhub_stole_from_me_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to/

Will I ever get approved for credit again? 

Are there ways to improve my credit despite being bankrupt?

Will I be able to keep access to lines of credit that I already have access to like Affirm, Klarna, etc. I know using those apps are frowned upon but they come in handy when you need something in a pinch. 

What is court like? I’m actually scared to ask the lawyer this question. Do they make you take the stand and explain why you are in bankruptcy court or is it just a legal formality that doesn’t mean much?

I do not plan to buy a house in this area (the Greater New Orleans area) unless I hit the Powerball and can buy the house outright. But if I ever changed my mind, will I be approved for a mortgage?

Speaking of the lottery, if I hit the lottery, will the court take my money? Will they have to claim the money before I get the rest?

I have a bank account at a credit union where my car is financed. Will I be kicked out of the union?

The only items I have that are worth anything are my iPad and an automobile diagnostic scanner that I use to repair my brakes.  Neither are worth $500. Will I have to give those up?

Current 25 y/o, with roughly $30k of debt consisting of payday loans, a secured loan, credit cards and some balances for pay in fours (Klarna for example). I have one primary job, but I’ve accepted and scheduled to work a second. Every two weeks from my primary job I make roughly $1750, income from the second job is a potential $300 every week. 

Expenses come to around $1,800/mo, which includes $250/mo for the secured loan pay off, the rest is rent, utilities, etc. 

The secured loan sits at a $6.8k bal, all other debt have gone to collections. My goal is to pay off everything as soon as possible, I’m aiming for within 1-2 years. 

I’ve researched debt relief programs, came across National Debt Relief, but I understand some of the debts would not be accepted under the program (roughly $6k of the remaining $23.2k). I am also unsure if NDR accepts any debts that have been forwarded to collections agencies.

My tentative plan is to use $2k/mo for my debts not including the secured loan ($500/mo to NDR, $1500/mo to the debts not included in NDR). After the debts not included in the NDR have been paid off, I’m want to shift my monthly splits to $1k/mo for the debt relief, $1k/mo for the secured loan (in addition to the previously stated $250/mo). Once the secured loan is paid off, all $2k/mo to the debt relief program.

Does this sound like a viable plan to tackle my debt? Are there things I have not considered or that I should look into? Any advice is welcome.

Total in debt: $39,533.77

I have zero issue with my USAA auto loan that is always my **first priority** and always gets paid on time but due to some really bad choices I have racked up a large amount of credit card debt. My monthly car insurance is $261 dollars monthly (I am insured with State Farm, I live in Illinois please let me know if you know of any cheaper insurance companies. I have tried all the other big insurers and they all quoted me over 500 a month. Geico, liberty mutual, Progressive, USSA.) I made the mistake of moving out too and in with my boyfriend. I do not pay rent with my boyfriend but I do help with groceries. Due to a large amount of tickets, some of which I can’t even pay, things have gotten out of hand with my finances and I want to rid myself of this debt. Unfortunately the snowball method is out of the picture now… I think…

So, the total in debt we are currently concerned about is, ***$12,511.01***

(I am currently at $15 an hour, I should be working 40 hours a week but usually it’s a little less.) I get paid roughly $900 every two weeks (After tax, usually before tax it’s $1,200). I used to get paid on a biweekly basis but just this past week I got changed to a semimonthly pay basis (15th and EOM).

I have heard of debt transfer credit card, but I fear I do not have a high enough credit score to get one that would help with my situation.

Experian: 570

Equifax: 584

TransUnion: 603

My credit score used to be at 749. It is insane to see how quickly that can change in only ONE year.

I am a complete imbecile, I know.

It started to go down when I would apply to finance cars. I don’t know if there is any way I can get those off my report, but I thought I would throw that out there if anyone has any advice on that part.

I want to just do a total debt consolidation with a loan, but as you can imagine it’s hard, near impossible to get a loan with a score such as mine. Websites that offer me loans with a credit score like mine seem sketchy and not trustworthy.

I have already ruled out debt relief companies, I know they are a scam. I also understand the snowball method, I had been trying that but it’s clear my expenses with credit cards surpass what my income is. I have been applying to jobs that work with my current work schedule, but I’m afraid it’s time for action. I am wondering if any of you know any creditors that would loan me money, debt consolidation institutions, anything that would help me.

If you suggest uber I encourage you to take a gander at my amazing fourteen miles to the gallon. My BMW is a thirsty V8. I refuse to sell her, it wouldn’t make sense due to it being on a loan.

The customer service rep was very kind, and let me know that they were able to relieve him/me of all outstanding loans in his name. I sent a copy of his death certificate, and it was all taken care of same day. I can’t express what a relief this experience was, from the help here to the help from affirm. Thank you, everyone. Slowly working on everything else.*



Hi all, my husband (38m) passed away very suddenly on 2/4 and I’m slowly working to unwind some of our finances. My post history has one in askdocs explaining what happened, please look at that before asking me for details if you can help it… it’s really hard for me to keep writing about it because there are very few answers right now. Shortened version is he seems to have passed in a matter of minutes from sudden cardiac arrest, possibly triggered by an undiagnosed or newly developed arrhythmia.

My husband had a mattress and peloton financed through Affirm, but I haven’t been able to see a location on their site to alert them of his passing, or a number to call. I’m grieving pretty heavily so I may have missed it, but if anyone knows what I can do to let them know that would be incredibly helpful. 

Basically all of our bills are in my name, which makes some of this a lot easier. Even so, he has a small amount of credit card debt and these two small financed purchases (both ~ $1000/each based on texts his phone has gotten). 

He passed while driving home but did not crash, somehow amid what seems to be sudden/unexplained cardiac arrest he unconsciously hit his breaks and the car stopped before hitting anything, but his car insurance is still covering a number of final expenses including a death benefit. So that’s not an issue, thank goodness

Any advice helps… thank you",[1000.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1117edr/husband_passed_unexpectedly_but_had_2_purchases/

t5_2qstm,Someone took out an Affirm loan in my name and it has been sent to collections,"Someone took out an Affirm loan in my name and it has been sent to collections About a month ago, I was checking my Credit Score on Credit Karma, excited because I anticipated an increased score since I paid off my credit card debt. To my surprise, my credit score decreased by 60 points because of two new collections from Affirm. Unbeknownst to me, there was a total loan amount of $708 fraudulently taken out under my name. 

I immediately did a search of my personal records and history and found that an Affirm account has been active under an email I no longer use. I initially forgot that I used Affirm once in 2017 to purchase a phone from Gazelle, but was issued a refund after I returned the item for being wrong.  After the unpleasant experience, I did not use Affirm or Gazelle again. 

Fast forward to 01/2020, I received an email from Affirm confirming a loan to Walmart Stores. Since then, I’ve been receiving emails from Affirm notifying me that “Auto-Pay failed.” Again, i no longer use this email address (I made this email back in middle school), so I was not initially aware of these emails. 

I immediately filled a dispute with TransUnion and Experian. I called Affirm to report the fraudulent charge and they gave me a case number and let me know someone from their fraud department would reach out. Well, I finally got word back and was told that the available information they have indicates I am responsible for the loans with Walmart and Gazelle (only the Walmart loan is shown in collections). I DID initiate a loan to Gazelle and have proof that it was refunded in full. I am NOT responsible for the loan with Walmart. Not to mention, I have never shopped online for Walmart. 

What can I do to prove the Walmart loan is not my responsibility and I did not authorize this transaction? Any advice would be great.

Now they want me to pay $550 out of pocket. :( Maybe this isn't the best place to ask? Maybe someone can guide me to a better subreddit for this question? :)


So my insurance doesn't really kick in until I reach my $6000 deductible. OK, fine. But dang! Having insurance doubled what I owe to the hospital!


Long story is, my doctor said I had to get some bloodwork. The receptionist told me to check out the lab in the hospital (1 minute walk from the doctor's front door). I'm dumb. I went. Mistake #1. I asked if they take my insurance, they said ""Heck yeah we do"". 5 minutes of bloodwork later and I'm driving home. (If I had not listened to the receptionist's advice and just driven to the lab down the street.........)


I get a bill in the mail 3 months later. The total bill is $1600. Since I don't have insurance (what?) they want $290. This is where I make mistake #2. I call the hospital's billing company and tell them ""Hey I have insurance, what the heck? Why am I being billed $290 for 5 minutes of bloodwork?"" They say ""Oh dear, looks like we took your insurance number down wrong. We'll put the payment on hold while we contact your insurance company."" *In hindsight I should have paid the $290!*


1 month passes. I get an updated bill in the mail. The total bill is $1600. Since I have insurance, they want $550. From me. My insurance, bless their hearts, got my bill down from $1600 to $550. **What?**


I called the billing company and asked if I could just pay the $290 from the original bill. ""Sorry! $550 please or we send it to collections!""


I called my insurance company and asked if they cared, at all, about any of this. They don't care.


Does anyone have any ideas? Am I screwed? Just pay the $550? Is there some magical word I have to say to the insurance person to get them to fight for the $290 rate?

t5_2qstm,"i took 6 months off work, and survived!","i took 6 months off work, and survived! Hi PF! 



In November last year, I decided that I would take extended time off work to spend time with my long distance (Transpacific) SO in California. I preferred unpaid leave because I believed it’d improve my chances with US Border Control (demonstrate intent to return home), and also since I would rather keep a bird on hand and my options open.



I managed to pull it off without burning a hole in my pocket, so maybe PF will enjoy my tale (all figures in USD)!



**Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork (aka, research and negotiate)**

I’d been working in a fairly large organization, where extended unpaid leave was rare, but did happen. There were no HR guidelines or formal process, so I dug around, speaking to people from HR, people who knew people who tried taking time off. I found out that taking time off “to accompany a spouse overseas on temporary assignment” had a high-hit-rate while bearing the closest resemblance to my own reasons. I also knew that I had some leverage including being generally high performing (and since HR was measured on negative attrition, they had a vested interest in keeping me from leaving).

So I made my request sound as close as I could to the proven narrative, while remaining factually accurate (in effect making it seem that my SO and I may be closer to getting married than we actually are). I also reiterated that I desired to stay and grow with the organization in the long term, but it was also balancing this intent against the shorter-term exigencies of being long distance with my SO (hinting that I would consider resigning as a last resort).

The process of getting support involved multiple conversations with supervisors and bosses, HR and higher levels of HR. It took weeks for me to get the approvals, and many more weeks to lock down an actual period and start date.

In the meantime, I read up on long-term visa options for the US, horror stories about US border control, etc. Alas, my visa bid for a longer-term (6 mth) visa was not granted (embassy staff said I would need to be visiting my family / spouse to qualify), which sent a $200 processing fee down the drain ☹. My only option was to enter the US on an ESTA, which meant staying 90 days at a time, and managing the risk of being denied entry by border control in subsequent visits.



**Phase 2: Making a Plan (aka budget like crazy)**

With a date in clearer sight, I was starting to crap my pants, because holy shit this is happening. I’d never been one for very detailed budgeting and tracking, but I knew this would be an expensive year, with only 4+ months of guaranteed income. On the upside, generally healthy PF habits have left me with no debt, an emergency fund, some money set aside for retirement/investments, and some liquid savings in various high-interest savings accounts. My financial goal was to make it through the year without drawing down on my savings. 

This was how I saw my financial situation:

***Guaranteed income for 2016***: ~$24,000 (4.5 months salary + bonuses from work last year)

***Budget for 2016***: $23,450

***Lumpy Expenses (Annual Budget)***

-	Flights & Related Costs: $4200 (2x long haul return flights)

-	Healthcare: $500

-	Clothes: $350

-	Personal Care & Hobbies: $800

-	Gifts: $500

-	Income Tax: $1000 (my tax is billed after year of assessment)

-	Emergency Fund / Contingency: $2000

	
***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: $500/mth, 6 mths [SO said I shouldn’t pay for accommodation, but I decided to budget for it anyway]

-	US Phone Line: $30/mth, 6 mths

-	Rent & Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths

-	Food: $200/mth

-	Transport: $60/mth

-	Entertainment: $50/mth



**Phase 3: Hitting the Tracks (pun intended)**

To keep track of my finances, I started an excel workbook with the following itemized and categorized spreadsheets:

-	expenditures 

-	income 

-	holdings


The data from these spreadsheets were summarized and consolidated into a overview page which provided a month by month breakdown of my expenditures, incomes, holdings, tracked my cumulative savings/debt for the year, and gave a rough sense of my overall net worth.



**The Result**
 
***Actual Income for 2016***: $35000 (and ~$4000+ expected in December)

***Actual Budget for 2016*** (extrapolated from 10+ mths actuals): $24,200

***Lumpy Expenses (Total for the year)***

-	Flights & Related Costs: $4500    *(+300 from budget)*

-	Healthcare: $900     *(+400 from budget)*

-	Clothes: $1300    *(+~1000 from budget)*

-	Personal Care & Hobbies: $1500    *(+700 from budget)*

-	Gifts: $1000    *(+500 from budget)*

-	Income Tax: $1200    *(+200 from budget)*

-	Contingency Money: $100


***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: ~$500/mth, 6 mths *(no change)*

-	US Phone Line: $35/mth, 6 mths *(slightly more than budget)*

-	Rent & Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths *(no change)*

-	Food: $175/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Transport: $55/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Entertainment: $40/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

I ended up keeping fairly close to budget, but splurged a little on some of my discretionary spend, particularly doing some travelling within the US, shopping for cold wear, work clothes, and high quality clothes/shoes for camping, and because I got into gardening. 

In our initial plan, my SO insisted that I should not pay for accommodation, but I had budgeted for it anyway. Along the way, some crazy shit happened but in short his mum became flat broke and homeless, moved into the half of his duplex that was meant for rental out. She stayed rent free and borrowed money. He didn’t want to burden me since I was technically unemployed, so I ended up squirreling money to him through a seemingly neverending stash of cash I had in the house. I also spent less on food, transport and entertainment than expected since we spent a lot of time cooking, cuddling and watching Netflix. 

On the income front, I ended up earning more than projected in part because I didn’t count on returning to work immediately after my break, and also from the following:

-	taking up illustration commissions (~$2,000)

-	interest and dividends (~$2,000)

-	nice relatives who were worried I might run out of money and stuffed me bunches of cash (~$1,000)

-	more bonus than I expected (~$2000)

-	selling stuff (~$200)



**Random things I learnt along the way**

-	Manually keying in expenditures definitely made me a lot more mindful of my spending, and think twice about splurging on things I don’t need. I highly recommend it!

-	Being prepared goes a long way. On my second leg back into the US, the border control officer held me back for a bit since I’d just spent 90 days in the US fairly recently (I buffered 2.5 weeks before returning). But when I whipped out my binder with documentation for every visa guideline (ESTA, flight tickets, travel insurance, employment letter back home, approval of leave dates, last performance appraisal, latest statements of all my savings, retirement and investment accounts, and pictures with my SO, etc.) he was like whoa, ok. I guess you did your homework, and he let me through pretty much immediately.

-	It’s 100% worth spending on items of good quality. During the trip, I got a pair of very good, very waterproof hiking boots ($70, on sale!), and it feels amazing waddling through streams without having to worry about my feet getting wet!

-	Plan using only your guaranteed income, and budget with contingency in the picture. Living the plan gets a lot less stressful when any additional income becomes a bonus, while unexpected emergency expenses are soaked up by your contingency budget.

-	Looking for work in the US is really hard! I tried testing the waters and sent out my resume, customized cover letters, etc. to maybe 50 companies. Most didn’t reply, some rejected me, and I got a grand total of two (informal) interviews from companies that weren’t actually keen to consider me at all (cause of visa), but thought my CV was interesting enough to meet me. Welp!

-	It feels pretty damn good to be on the airline priority list. It is an inexplicable joy exiting a long haul flight and seeing your luggage be one of the first out on the belt. If you fly often, don’t forget to sign up on a frequent fliers program and be sure to claim your miles. 

-	Sometimes life sucks and you just have to deal with it. ☹ Prior to my rejection at the US Embassy, I had tried calling them, and emailing them to clarify the visa eligibility and guidelines specific to my situation, but they gave unhelpful and non-committal replies that neither affirmed nor denied my eligibility, and stated that I should make an appointment with a visa officer who could better assess my request. Unfortunately the Embassy is not like a place where you can call in to demand that they process a refund / fee waiver.



**TL;DR**: I took six months off work to spend time with my long distance SO in the US. The goal was to be budget neutral this year. I made it through with net savings of $10,000, while picking up new hobbies (gardening), great experiences in the American outdoors, and some pretty cool learning points relating to budgeting, planning, employment, immigration and being prepared in general. 


*edited for formatting*

EDIT: 

Holy crap, i woke up this morning and my inbox was totally flooded. I've been responding to comments, but am back home from work and can do a proper update. 


1) Several of you asked if some of the things I did were legal. I clarified this in some of my responses. Basically, I did my best to research as much as possible, keep within the legal limits of what my visa type allowed me to do, and err on the side of caution when in doubt. For instance, taking on commissions only in my home country, keeping most job hunting activities outside of the US, and returning home with some buffer during the course of 6 months so I did not overstay. When in the US, I didn't work, but I did try a bit to fish around for possible future work opportunities. As I definitely did not wish to run afoul of immigration policy, I kept any job-related enquiries general, informal and exploratory, while caveating my emails / letters with my visa situation and how I was open to exiting and entering the country on a different visa if they would sponsor me on a valid employment visa. 

2) Some were curious as to how I eventually tracked my budgets and 'kept to plan'. There's a lot of very personal information in my 2016 sheet that I don't feel comfortable sharing, but here's a cleaned up version of the spreadsheet I made, with some placeholder info in each of the tabs to show how it works. The overview page is automatically populated by subsequent spreadsheets [Spreadsheet here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uuyj3JQrkj-wWdOz6VOzvE5sLGBHrcRrTN_RFU1LlHo)

3) A few mentioned that you are in a similar long distance relationship with someone in a different country, and would like to do something similar in future. I thought that you might find a cleaned up version of my projection spreadsheet, with placeholder information useful, though you may need some excel knowledge to customise it for your specific purpose. [projection template here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X6ThpIFXEfo-kB0iob_Xiq4U3K5NBl9Z7xwHdg-Pe1Q).

t5_2qstm,Affirm and late payments,"Affirm and late payments I have been a customer with affirm for YEARS. I have never had a late payment and have multiple large purchases paid off on time, if not early. My check was delayed last month due to presidents day, and I had 3 payments due on the same day. I paid them 2 days later and have continued to make my other payments on time for the past month since it happened.

Now they are telling me that my $2500 purchasing power is completely gone, and when I call to talk to customer service, they tell me that they cannot give me any information on it and all I can do is wait for it to ""refresh"", even though I have been waiting for one month already.

When the app asks me to check my purchasing power, it acts as if it's loading up and then just goes back to the home page. When I try to make a purchase with affirm to test it, it tells me my purchase cannot be approved. I just don't understand how paying 3 days late ONCE in 5 years has them take the entire service from me?!

Is firm a good place to get a loan from? I’m 18 so will they deny me for no credit history? If i do go for the monthly can I put like 200ish bucks in to pay it off faster than 36 months?

t5_2qstm,Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC?,"Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC? Hey Everyone.

So recently I(22M) tried building a new pc and it didn’t turn out well at all. I fried some of the components when building it and had to return some of my components. 

As such, I’m in the market for a new gaming pc. However, I to make sure that I’m not putting myself in a hole financially. I currently make $1,750 a month and have been doing a decent job by following the 50/30/20 rule. My expenses are car insurance, gas, therapy, and car maintenance. 

But, as time has gone on as I wait for my $1000 refund from Amazon, I’m seeing some amazing deals go by that would bet me a gaming computer well around the price of just straight building it. And I’m wondering if I should apply for a BNPL Service such as affirm so I don’t miss out on some deals. 

Important things to note! 

I’m going to pursue my MSW this fall at Hunter College and unsure if these BNPL services will affect my chances for getting student loans. 

I also will not be making that much money during this time but I know I can pay the PC off by the end of august so I don’t pay that much interest. 

I also recently applied for a new credit card during the month of June. I did so because I knew I was going to meet the amount for the sign on bonus. 

Please let me know you’re feedback as I’m open to everything and would like to know what’s the best financial decision here.

Edit: To everyone the responded to my post, I really appreciate the feedback and wanted to update everyone on the decision I came to. So, I reached out to the affirm and asked them how much interest I would pay. So, assuming I did sign up, although I would be paying less interest if I paid within the first month, I would still be incurring interest each day. 

Example: 

$2100 Computer, interest is 15%. If I paid at the end of that month, I would have $2,415. Then interest I would’ve paid would be $315. However, they would distribute that payment over the course of the month. 

So, instead of paying one month after my purchase, and I paid 15 days after. I would be paying off my product along with $157.50 since they incur interest daily. 

TLDR; I’m going to save now and pay later. I’ll start looking for a computer once I have enough money saved up.","[1750.0, 1000.0, 2100.0, 2415.0, 315.0, 157.5]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/158x9zv/should_i_get_affirm_for_my_new_gaming_pc/
t5_2qstm,Affirm/ incorrect reporting resulting in chargeoff item was returned,"Affirm/ incorrect reporting resulting in chargeoff item was returned I was wondering if anyone had the same situation whereas affirm charged off an account on a product that was refunded in full and had auto pay sounds crazy right but it happened and I am still fighting it  on top of that I had an excellent credit score and this put me in a different credit rating category completely.   February 15th 2023 purchased an item from Amazon funded via affirm, by end March /April it was to be returned due to damage done to my home. Spoke with  Amazon who stated that they can take it back.... however, they could not fix the damage to the home,  so in order for that to be done, I would have to return to the manufacturer( which I did I have a case FedEx Tracking emails to prove all of that as well)

I then  informed Amazon AND Affirm (have chat screenshots on that ) figured it would have been handled appropriately .  Fast forward to October 2023, realizing I am still being Auto drafted for a product I no longer have($25.88)  for months and at $25 it's easy to overlook that coming out of your account. Then coming to find  that neither side did their due diligence to cancel it or make each other aware that this was returned.  I no longer had the product.   I spent countless hours  between work breaks  arguing my point, showing proof , emailing  screenshots ..until finally I demanded for arbitration and Amazon reached out to affirm and let them know they had the documentation to support( which was the same carbon copy I sent to affirm so they should have had it as well) .  I then called a firm spoke with multiple people made multiple chat messages all with the same response until I finally made my final phone call to them in November I believe it was on the 11th( I would have to look back at my notes) spoke with Christian who stated he apologized this wasn't handled he sees all the information he doesn't know why it was never forward it to the correct department for this to be handled and he assured that it was going to get handled he sent out an email and then on the 13th affirm answered me via email indicating they are processing it as a full refund and sending me $25.88 back for an overpayment that I must have made again this was always on auto pay until I believe October in which I had finally had it no one should pay for a product that they no longer had because representatives of the company did not do their due diligence and handle this way back in March when I no longer had the product this is an acceptable and I should not have had to continue to pay for it regardless of what a firm States on their website but I did unknowingly because of auto pay I should not be robbed for money on a product I no longer have because they fail to communicate with each other that shouldn't fall on the client
Then  12/9 an email was sent to me that for $25.88 it was being charged off. I did not receive the email until later in the month because I had no reason to look out for Affirm any longer as I had no other accounts with them everything was paid in full including this particular item that was returned so when I happen to see something that caught my eye with the word charge off in my thousands of emails I opened it found that the situation was never rectified in toto who was the last person I
 why would a company put me into charge off and collections for the same amount that they sent to me if I owed them money . I am currently fighting this with Better Business Bureau cfpb and I may need to take it to fcra because at this point the damage that was done to my credit caused adverse reaction it's very similar to somebody going to jail for something they didn't do wrong and then being released , your reputation is still tarnished in this case my credit report is still tarnished the algorithms that the credit bureaus utilize will never bring it back up to the high standing I had it and I suffered adverse effects because I needed to combine and utilize a particular loan to fix something that broke was in my home and I was denied and that is where I realized that they made a reporting even though I fought them and I told them and showed them there is no way that this should be a correct reporting.  
They are now even still fighting as accurate even without Merit .  I have to contact an attorney I did reach out to a person I know who is an attorney who has a colleague who deals with this who stated it's clearly evident but because they are not in my state I would have to find someone within my state. I also demanded arbitration and was never given the correct information to mail the letter to I was disconnected by the offshore reps indicating they couldn't hear me which also means they probably didn't have the answer or were told if that ever gets brought up to disconnect the call has anybody else dealt with this because this is ridiculous.  I HAVE overwhelming evidence that is in my favor and validates what I'm stating but yet they Overlook it my belief is somewhere along the line a ball was dropped and now no one is accepting accountability.  I am not asking for much any insight from other whoever went through this can you please help instruct me on what else I could do besides now having to take the extra time for arbitration and an attorney

Planning to use $10,300 check to help with the issue but not sure how to use it. My wife and I have racked up a ridiculous amount of credit card debt due to schooling, hardships, and indulgences. $27,000 to be exact. Thankfully, we no longer have to rely on credit cards, but now we’re dealing with the consequences of having used them. We pay a little over $1,000 a month toward these credit cards, and we can’t stand it.

Luckily, I have a $10,300 check coming in this month from the state—they’re buying a piece of my inherited land. (I can’t sell the land; it has been in my family for generations.) This will take a huge burden off our shoulders. But now I’m stuck with the question of how to use this check most efficiently to pay off our debt.

One option is to use the check as a down payment for a personal loan. However, my concern is whether lenders would deny the application since our credit cards are maxed out. My other idea is to pay off some of the credit card debt first and then apply for a personal loan. If that’s the better route, how should I disburse the check to improve our chances of getting approved?

Here’s our credit cards incase paying them directly would better suit us. If so, I’d like to know how to disburse the check among these cards.

Discover: $17500
PayPal: $4,000
Affirm: $2500
Capital One: $2200
Chase: $500
Walmart: $300

So my debit card was skimmed last month as suggested by my bank! Someone, took close to $800 in 4 transactions, 2 atm withdrawal and 2 Point of sale.

I was alerted by my credit union's fraud alert when they tried to make a purchase at a grocery store. I immediately put a hold on my card and alerted the fraud division for my credit union in less than an hour. 

They(thief)  had already made the 3 previous transaction and the 4th one is when i got to know about the fraud. 

The next day, during my credit unions business hours, i informed them about the theft and they asked me to dispute the transactions and provisionally credited me the money. They said since the card was with me when these transactions happened, my card was most likely skimmed.

Friday, they(credit union) come back to me with a decision and deny my dispute stating that a valid card and pin were present. 

I called the police and i filed a report with them because i didn't know what else to do. I'm in CA so I'm guessing they won't even look into.my case as it is under $950.

I don't know what to do and I'm stressing out. $800 is a lot of money for me and I can't afford to lose it. What should i do reddit?


Update: Thank you for your help, each and everyone of you! This is the update


 I gave the Credit Union the police details, however they said:
""They(dispute dept) are adding that to the notes, however since the dispute has already been closed you will need to work with the police on the matter. I can provide you with the information the disputes department has given me via email, or I can show you the reason why the dispute was denied here in chat. Which would you prefer?""


The email they sent contained two images. One of a excel sheet image with the transaction info with just request and approvals and 5-chip reader in the POS card data input mode. And other image with no info but the amount and Loss Potential High. I don't know what to make sense of that.

Edit: To answer most of the questions:
-I normally say my husband “left us” when I’m asked by strangers, mainly because the truth still doesn’t seem real but he was in a car accident a few months back. He did not survive it. I’m only adding this because so many people asked about child support which is obviously not an option. Also, most of the debt was in both of our names we bought all of this together and with his income it was never bad, as in, I never felt like we were struggling for money. For years we used the JetBlue card to visit family, we bought this house about a year ago and we bought some furniture we needed, the payments were 0 interest and did not seem bad at the time with both our incomes. The only ones that are mine alone are target, Sephora and ulta. They were much higher and I had chipped away at them but when the accident happened I let everything slide. I don’t know how to manage everything on my own. So I thought stupidly I’d ask Reddit for help and advice. But, wow most of you guys are so mean without knowing any of the backstory or details, you just assume and spew hate.  I hope you never have to know the pain of losing your partner. 
-I’m still waiting on life insurance policy but I’m not sure how much that is going to be. It’s through his employer but he was only there for about 3 years so I don’t think it’ll be much.
-My mom had a stroke a year ago, she used to have a good job and at the moment she can barely move or talk. I can’t help at all with her care since I’m far away, my sister does everything and so I offered to take some of her debt since she’s not able to pay it at the moment. She only has those two cards and an Amex that she pays with her SS. I understand that right now in the situation I’ve found myself in I can’t afford to pay it but it’s the only thing I can do for my mom right now so I don’t know how to tell my sister I’m not going to pay it anymore. I’m sure she’ll understand but it makes me feel like I’m helping and before all of this it wasn’t a burden to pay for them. 
-A lot of you suggested I seek help for my “spending problem” I don’t know if I necessarily have a spending problem but I am seeing a licensed therapist and psychologist and am on medication for depression (obviously) and anxiety which help some.

I have a question regarding AFFIRM. So last december I bought 2 purses at Neiman Marcus using AFFIRM. The total amount of Loan was $4,XXX. First purse arrived on January (Amount was $2,XXX) didnt like the size and so i decided to return it a week later. 2nd purse was on backorder which I just received 2 days ago, and I would like to keep it. 

Neiman marcus sent me an email a week later that return was accepted and that they have issued refund (January 19, 2021) I was charged once by Affirm on January and though its okay since I have another purchase with them. Fast forward to February 23, 2021 my loan is still showing full amount, I called neiman marcus and they said they have issued full refund for the $2,XXX purse. They told me to call Affirm, and so I did-- affirm said neiman marcus hasnt issued  the refund yet & that they placed a hold on the $2,XXX purse. Called Neiman marcus again they said no they didnt place any hold & the refund has been issued and there's nothing more they could do on their end because they has issued full refund. Called affirm again and they said they need enough evidence showing that neiman marcus has issued the refund & that my remaining loan amount is only for the 2nd purse which is $1,XXX. Requested for that ""evidence"" from neiman marcus and the manager told me that they couldnt generate that kind of email since they already sent me an email on Janury 19, 2021 confirming  the return & the refund. Sent that email to Affirm but they said that email wont suffice as an evidence. 

I've been back and forth--- calling both companies multiple times a day and no one has helped me. Now i have a loan of $4,XXX and the $2,XXX purse has been returned but im still being charge for it. Using affirm was a nightmare. if anyone could enlighten me & help me regarding my situation, i would highly appreciate it. thank you in advance.","[4.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 2.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lraz60/affirm_wont_issue_refund_merchant_said_they/

With affirm, I have the option to pay it off in 12 monthly increments of $264.81 meaning that by the end, I'd have paid Affirm an extra $418.31 for the cost of borrowing, giving me a grand total of $3177.74. 

If I go this route, I would likely pay it fully off sometime over the next 3 - 4 months (despite having the option to pay over 12). My concern/question now is, if I pay it off early will I still end up owing them the full $3177.74 when I go to pay it off?

Well it was a preorder and i wasn't supposed to get my items till late July. Fast forward mid August never received an update so i emailed the merchant and no reply. Almost September no products so send more emails and no reply. Same goes on through end of September.

Looked online for my options and it said I needed to contact the merchant for a refund and if if that didn't work contact my bank. Give them a few more weeks. I finally get tired of it and call my bank and they give me a charge back.

Well today I get an email stating my loan was sent to collections since i did a charge back. I call and they tell me my only solution is to pay it and unless the merchant gives me a refund I'm out $61. 

They said I would have had to file a dispute 60 days after the loan was approved to get a refund so even if I would have done it probably I would have been out $61.

I don't feel like i need to pay for something I never received and they aren't giving me any information to fix this and their only solution is for me to pay it or have the merchant refund it.

What can i do about this?

t5_2qstm,Chase bank lost my $25k wire transfer and has not got it back for 3 weeks,"Chase bank lost my $25k wire transfer and has not got it back for 3 weeks Hi Reddit, what I have experienced is so absurd that I have to post this.

On Jan. 23rd, I initiated a wire transfer of $25k to my wife from my Chase account to her BofA account. That day is a Saturday so we waited until the following Monday. On Jan. 25th Monday, the money was taken out of my Chase checking account, but it did not show up in my wife's account. We finally decided to call our banks on Jan. 30th Friday, after not receiving the wire transfer after 5 days.

We first called Chase bank, whose representatives (we called many times) claimed that the wire transfer had been completed and the money should be at the recipient bank. We then called BofA, who then claimed that they had never received any wire transfer, and that we should follow up with the sender bank. OK, so we went back to Chase telling them this story, who unsurprisingly insisted that the wire transfer had been completed. One of the Chase representatives brought up that I could start a recall request, but in the disclosure she read that the recall is not guaranteed. That sounds fishy? I asked: ""so you're saying there's a chance the money is just lost?"" and received affirmative answer. This person simply did not care where the $25k was and where it would end up. Anyhow, I started the recall request on the phone.

The next Monday we decided that we couldn't wait at home and headed to the banks' local branches. We first went to BofA, where a banker helped us do some research. What shocked me was that the banker needed to call the SAME phone number that we had been calling and had to wait for around half an hour before anyone picked up. Before the phone call, the banker assured us confidently that we would find our money, but after she hung up, we were back to square one: the wire department said that they had not seen any money coming in, or on the transit.

Some context here: the BofA banker told us a story that in the past sometimes the name gets messed up, so the money would be stuck on somewhere called the ""transit"", which is basically a middle ground for wiring transfers. Someone just needs to go and find it.

Ok, so the BofA banker, again, told us to follow up with Chase bank, since the sender bank would have more information and can ""trace the money in the terminal"".

We then went to the Chase bank.

I guess I should have been used to it by that time, but it was also shocking to see that the Chase banker, sitting in a glass door office, had to dial the phone for customer service number and waited on hold for 15 minutes to get anything done. Apparently they could not find the money either. Just when I was dreading about the matter, my Chase private client banker heard about this and came in. She told me that she had already started working on the recall request and that we would for sure get the money back. They showed me an internal email that showed the expectation should be around 3-5 business days. My CPC banker also suggested that I send an inquiry through their online banking ""secure message center"", which apparently goes into a different department and can possibly get me some answers.

The next day, Jan 31st Tuesday, my CPC banker called me and explained that the reason the wire transfer did not go through initially was that BofA had asked for additional details: my full legal name and my date of birth. Well that's weird, doesn't Chase have that information? Why would the money be stuck for a whole week? I was not able to get these questions answered.

Around the same day, the secure message center got back, with the following message:

>Thank you for contacting Retail Wire Servicing. We received your request dated 02/02/21 for wire transfer in the amount of 25000/USD dated 01/25.  We have acknowledged your request to know the reason why the wire was not credited to beneficiaries account there is a case follow up for this wire transaction/reference number.xxxxx  The update is as follows: • On 01/26 message received from BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.stating ""REQUIRE ADDL DETAILS PLEASE PROVIDE THE FULL AND COMPLETE LEGAL NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH FOR \[My name\].  
>  
>They were waiting for these details from you in order to credit the wire to beneficiaries account .

They were waiting for these details from ME?

The whole time I received zero communication from Chase bank, email, phone or text message saying that I need to provide ANY info for my wire transfer. Every status on Chase shows that the transaction has been completed, so did every Chase representative tell me. Now Chase is sending a message telling me that I should have done something? The absurdness is blowing my mind.

I replied pointing this out and asked for a written apology and monetary compensation for the time lost. No human response. Only another update that says

>We have acknowledged your request for a case follow up for this wire transaction/reference number.xxxxx  The status update is as follows: • No response yet from the other bank but we just sent a follow up regarding our recall request

I asked for updates twice this week, and received basically the same message like below:

>Regarding debit to your account xxxx for 25,000.00/USD dated 1/25/2021 your payment reference number PPL OF 21/01/25 our transaction reference number xxxx .We have been advised by ReceivingBank of the following message quote PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR CANCELLATION REQUEST. HOWEVER BEFORE WE CAN CANCEL AND RETURN THE PAYMENT WE WOULD NEED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. PLEASE PROVIDE THE FULL AND COMPLETE LEGAL NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH FOR xxxx. REGARDS, BANK OF AMERICA INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT xxxxx unquote.

The last one was received today. So BofA is asking for my name and DOB again and has not received any answer it seems like, and Chase is neither asking me for the info (nothing is needed from me from the message) nor replying to them. I replied to this message giving Chase my name and DOB (which is ridiculous) and I suppose I'll see what happens.

In the meantime, I have called my CPC banker multiple times, every time it sounds like she's sincere and has been working on it, but the lack of update is draining my patience.

Thanks to Reddit, I filed a cfpb complaint last week (around Feb 2) and have received a call on Feb 9th from someone from ""Chase executive office"" and got a verbal apology for the first time. The person on the phone claimed that they would start an investigation.

To this date (Feb 11 Thursday), my $25k is still not back in my account.

Pardon my writing. Immigrant here.

**TLDR: Chase lost my wire transfer of $25k, claimed transaction complete when I asked for it, and still has not got it back in my account.**

**Edit(2/12/2021**): CPC banker left me a voicemail this morning. Apparently the secure message capitalized above IS their way of asking my full legal name and date of birth. I'm still wrapping my head around how that's a question/request for me. Maybe I don't read English? Every time I read it, I interpret as a status update, saying ""BofA is saying **this** (asking for blah)"". The whole thing looks like a bot message and nowhere in the message are they asking **me** to reply to them with my info. I'm lucky I got used to the way they do things and guessed their intent yesterday and responded with the info. However, shouldn't they have my legal name and date of birth in the first place? How else do they verify my name and date of birth when I call?

Still mindblown right now. I filed an OCC complaint yesterday (I had already filed a CFPB complaint earlier).

No money back yet.

Since I filed two complaints from two different regulartory agencies (CFPB and OCC). There had been a moment when it crossed my mind ""this will cause them to make some duplicate effort"", but then I thought, why the \* do I care? I did not initiate any of this.

**Edit(2/12/2021 9:46AM PST)**: The money is back! A different Chase banker called me and on the phone call she noticed that the $25k has been credited on my account. I informed the banker of my ongoing complaints and she said that she would esclate the complaint. At this point I don't trust Chase's own complaint handling system and will follow through with my regulatory agencies complaints. I told the banker that their wiring is horrible and embarrassing. I also made sure she knew that the complaints were not targeted towards her but her company.

I want to say I won't stop until I get a formal apology, but in this world, you don't get what you want/deserve most of the times.","[25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lhrr49/chase_bank_lost_my_25k_wire_transfer_and_has_not/
t5_2qstm,Company went bankrupt and didn’t provide service. Filed a dispute with Affirm and Affirm sided with merchant. What are my options?,"Company went bankrupt and didn’t provide service. Filed a dispute with Affirm and Affirm sided with merchant. What are my options? Hello,

I’m looking for advise here because I honestly don’t know what to do about this situation or next steps as I’ve exhausted a lot of my options. 

Back in November, I signed my dog up for a 21 day board and training program. I went through this company who trained my other dog and I saw great results and decided to move forward with their board and train for my other more reactive dog. This included a transfer out lesson and a lesson at home plus equipment. I signed up for this via an Affirm loan of about $4k. I signed some contracts detailing their policies etc and of course their refund policy stating no refunds once training starts. No big deal, I knew I liked them and couldn’t see a reason why I wouldn’t continue service. 

The day I dropped off my dog I was given a run down of what would happen. I was to receive daily pictures and videos of progress, there were about 6-8 other trainers and my dog would receive training every hour during operating hours (about 12 hours a day). 

5 days after dropping my dog off, the company sent an email stating they have filed for bankruptcy. Great. In a separate email, they stated all training except the board and train would cease immediately. For the remaining, the trainings will be finished by only the owner. Additionally, we would not receive the 2nd at home transfer lesson. It also stated “if you feel uncomfortable about this at any time you may pick up your dog ahead of schedule”. 

I waited a few days to ponder my options and ultimately decided on picking him up due to:

1. No longer receiving any pictures or videos with updates. 
2. I highly doubt one guy was going to be able to provide the promised level of training as 8 trainers originally (because who knows how many dogs they still had in their board and train) 
3. A copious amount of bad Yelp reviews and social media posts from clients who claimed they signed up and provided money only for them to claim bankruptcy and keep the money + claims from people saying their dogs stopped being fed. 
4. I was not going to receive part of what I paid for (the transfer out lesson) nor further continued support which is also a benefit they state. 

I picked up my dog only 7 days into training. The owner would not come out to speak to me and the person I spoke to stated she didnt work there anymore but was a family friend helping out. She couldn’t provide any info about my dogs training nor a refund and simply stated bankruptcy lawyers would reach out. 

That same day I filed a dispute with Affirm and provided all information. 

2 months later, they close the dispute stating that the merchant provided the contract terms and that “services would have continued if I didn’t choose to pick up my dog” and told me I would need to work it out with the merchant, who obviously has disconnected their phone lines and make it impossible to contact any one about this. 

Afterwards, I tried filing a complaint with the CFPB and getting someone on the phone with Affirm. I spoke to someone who stated they would reopen the case and review further. 

The next day they closed the dispute yet again stating the same exact thing as before and then sent another message about my CFPB complaint stating that the late payments won’t affect my credit. 

So, that’s where I’m at. At this point I don’t know what my options are if I’m just SOL. Do I suck it up and pay it? Do I not pay it and just let it eat my credit? Do I lawyer up? Any advice appreciated. 

TL;DR 

Dog training company filed bankruptcy 5 days after taking my dog. Training I was promised was not going to be given such as quality, additional lessons, etc and company stated I can pick up my dog.

I just got my tax return back and I’m wondering how best to prioritize my debt payoff. I have $6500 on a credit card that I currently pay $250 every 2 weeks on, the minimum monthly payment is about $180, I’m just aggressively paying on it. I also have $5668 on an Affirm purchase, but if I pay off now I will only pay $3500 and save the difference in interest. Both loans/debts have a very similar interest rate (terrible). My tax return can pay off one fully but I’m not sure which one to do. I really hate spending big chunks of money, but this feels right to do. 

If I pay off the Affirm account, then I will also pay off a student loan as well. But for some reason that affirm account isn’t on my credit report, so paying it off will not help my credit score (hovering just a hair below 700 currently). We are looking to buy a house in the not so distant future so that’s something I’m considering as well. 

If I pay off the credit card, then my credit score will jump about 60 points. 

The other option (the one I am leaning towards) is pay off the Affirm account, and then use the rest on my credit card and continue to pay aggressively on it. 

For reference, my tax return was $7500. I have $17k in savings currently as well. So yes I could technically pay off both, but would rather just pay aggressively on one and keep my savings.

As the title states I have been using Sezzle to help my credit utilization issue. To help rebuild my credit I opened a secured card that currently has a $600 limit. This is great and I only use it for my monthly recurring bills however since it was my only account I would get dinged for high usage constantly. 

To combat this I found a company called sezzle that is a buy now pay later type of service with no annual fee and no interest if you make your 4 payments. (25% up front when you purchase and 25% biweekly for a total of 4 payments.) I use this to purchase my ""fun items"" with respect for my week to week budget and typically the items are no more than $400. Now sezzle has me at a $2700 limit for the service and since I used my SSN to verify my identity they report the payments and balance to my credit. 

Is this a good idea? It keeps me around 14% to 30% percent utilization depending on if I am currently purchasing an item with them. My standard credit card balance alone with the sezzle account open and not being used at about that 14% range. 

I was extremely careful reading the credit agreement before signing up and as long as I don't miss those payments I don't get the insane interest.","[600.0, 400.0, 2700.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10gj8n4/using_sezzle_to_cheese_my_credit_usage/

t5_2qstm,I Was Charged $205 for a Best Buy Gift Card I Never Authorized—How Do I Fight This?,"I Was Charged $205 for a Best Buy Gift Card I Never Authorized—How Do I Fight This? Hi everyone,  
I need some help and perspective as I’ve been royally victimized by Sezzle, the pay-as-you-go app.

Yesterday, I discovered that somehow, in the background of using my phone, Sezzle had processed a $205 transaction for a digital Best Buy gift card. To be clear, I had absolutely no intention of making this purchase. I cannot stress this enough. I wasn’t even on a Best Buy website, and I did not agree to finance a gift card in four installments. Yet, I was charged $52 immediately for the first payment, with three more $50 installments scheduled over the next two months.

When I saw the charge hit my account, I was shocked and confused. My first instinct was to contact Sezzle to cancel the transaction. Unfortunately, the more I talked to them and the multiple other parties involved, the more hopeless it felt. Sezzle’s representatives weren’t helpful, and it became clear that they weren’t interested in reversing or canceling the installment agreement. Best Buy also refused to help, citing their non-refundable gift card policy.

I’m now stuck paying for a product I didn’t want, didn’t authorize, and can’t use. I feel like a complete victim of a system error or glitch that no one is willing to take responsibility for.

**What I’ve Tried So Far:**

* Contacted Sezzle’s customer service multiple times. They claim they can’t cancel or refund the transaction.
* Reached out to Best Buy, but they said digital gift cards are non-refundable.
* Begun disputing the charge with my bank, but the payments are installment-based, which complicates things.

It’s not just about the money that’s made this a bad experience. It’s the effort of every party involved to create the most ridiculous storm of a problem for me to experience. The fact I accidently became contractually obligated to a finance agreement on a digital Best Buy gift card. That concept alone is so dumbfounding that it eases the anguish. It feels wrong that companies like Sezzle and Best Buy can shrug off responsibility for mistakes (or worse, fraudulent activity) like this.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I really appreciate any help or perspective you can offer!

If someone here has experienced something similar or knows what else I can do. Any advice, insights, or suggestions would mean a lot.

* Has anyone successfully disputed a transaction like this with Sezzle or a similar service?
* Are there other consumer protection agencies or legal routes I can pursue?
* Is there any way to sell or trade the gift card to recoup some of the money?","[205.0, 205.0, 52.0, 50.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gzy2qt/i_was_charged_205_for_a_best_buy_gift_card_i/

$450 a month in groceries
$350-400 a month in medications and medical equipment

Nonetheless the last few years I have been so overwhelmed and anxious about my debt that my brain said “ ignore it” but now im 26, and can’t get even most secured cards. credit score sitting around 500. I’ve had a few things recently go to collections but I have zero active accounts anymore. Everything’s in collections etc. I can’t live like this anymore because km physically DROWNING in debt. My husband and I also owe my mother in law some money for bills she helped when I was out for surgery etc. and she’s an awful person about it. I need it paid off so she can be removed from our lives. I’ve never even opened a savings account in my life. I couldn’t. 

Here’s the debt. The medical debt is to a hospital that has not reported anything on my credit, somehow??? I don’t get that so if anyone can explain I’d so appreciate that bc I get daily calls collecting debt but not on report. That being said I have $651,908 in medical debt

What I am worried about is getting out of my house. I hate it here living with my parents, my mother is very demanding and is a heavy part of my mental health issues causes. I've learned a lot this year about investing, financing, loans, and other to have a pretty basic grip on it.

The plan is to take out a student loan for a years worth of rent in my area ( about 20,000 ) so housing is secure and all I have to worry about is making payments every month instead of rent so if I miss one I don't get kicked out, etc etc.

I think this is a good plan to build credit while securing a place to live off-campus. I have a history of borrowing money from online shopping services, specifically Sezzle, and have put over $1,000 on it on payment plans, only missing 2 payments ( of $10 each ) over the past year.

I'm also in the process of getting a steady job (just recently resigned my job of 2 and a half years)

I think its smart, but you're the experts. Thoughts or advice?

EDIT/CLARIFICATIONS!

\> I'm getting $6,895 from FAFSA every year along with $3,700 every year for college. AKA $10,595 in scholarships per year, my school's tuition is about 5k. So, I'm getting a refund every semester of about 2,750 give or take a hundred. School is fully paid for by scholarships, they renew every year. This also doesn't take into account the 1,000 personal scholarships I got, the school's scholarship award that comes out in September, and a few other factors but simply put, I'm getting a refund every semester.  

\> Yeah, rent is expensive here in my city (2k a month is pretty average) Did a lot more talking and research today with family, instead gonna be doing student housing which is about 900 a month, making it about $10,800 a year so overestimating, under receiving I guess

If I set up a pay over time plan for an expense that cost more than $1000, I would get 5000 ultimate rewards points in return. 

So the way this works is I can choose to break up this one large expense over 6, 12, or 18 monthly payments with no interest but with a flat fee each month. I’m thinking of putting a recent $3750 expense on it and paying $650/month over 6 months ($25 flat fee per month). I’d only be paying $150 more over 6 months which is like 4% interest.

And once ive reached a comfortable number (not sure what that number is yet) then pay it outright.

I make a decent income but just started working full-time and don't have a large stockpile of cash to buy the ring outright without depleting my savings and losing money I need to payoff student debts once payments return.

I can probably put a down payment of $1500 towards it but would hope to pay the rest off in 100-200 dollar monthly payments with a preference of zero interest installments or at least a low APR (8 to 10 percent).  

My credit score currently is around 800 so I should qualify for most loans but I don't know where I can find such a small principal loan with low APR.  Is it better to just buy the full thing out of pocket, look to a pay in 4 BNPL, or is there a recommended personal loan that can fit my budgeted rate?

Edit:
Thank you for your quick responses, I think I didn't specify the situation completely. 

The 3k price tag came from shopping around and found that the design we both liked landed around 3k as the retail price for it, if there is a cheaper seller online that can provide the same design I'm open to it, the price is not set in stone. Not sure if this is the right subreddit for ring shopping though. 

Additionally, 3k being ""in budget"" meant that we have the money but it would be taking charge of other expenses such as saving towards a home down payment, the weddings, the honeymoon, and paying off some currently frozen student loans.  It's not impossible to pay out of pocket, it would just shift around priority on payments.   

Lastly, the timeline is limited on this since we want our family to make it to the event and the longer it takes to save up the money the less chance some of them will still be here for it.",[1500.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15nhu1w/best_finance_option_for_3k_engagement_ring/
t5_2qstm,Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC?,"Should I get Affirm for my new Gaming PC? Hey Everyone.

So recently I(22M) tried building a new pc and it didn’t turn out well at all. I fried some of the components when building it and had to return some of my components. 

As such, I’m in the market for a new gaming pc. However, I to make sure that I’m not putting myself in a hole financially. I currently make $1,750 a month and have been doing a decent job by following the 50/30/20 rule. My expenses are car insurance, gas, therapy, and car maintenance. 

But, as time has gone on as I wait for my $1000 refund from Amazon, I’m seeing some amazing deals go by that would bet me a gaming computer well around the price of just straight building it. And I’m wondering if I should apply for a BNPL Service such as affirm so I don’t miss out on some deals. 

Important things to note! 

I’m going to pursue my MSW this fall at Hunter College and unsure if these BNPL services will affect my chances for getting student loans. 

I also will not be making that much money during this time but I know I can pay the PC off by the end of august so I don’t pay that much interest. 

I also recently applied for a new credit card during the month of June. I did so because I knew I was going to meet the amount for the sign on bonus. 

Please let me know you’re feedback as I’m open to everything and would like to know what’s the best financial decision here.

Edit: To everyone the responded to my post, I really appreciate the feedback and wanted to update everyone on the decision I came to. So, I reached out to the affirm and asked them how much interest I would pay. So, assuming I did sign up, although I would be paying less interest if I paid within the first month, I would still be incurring interest each day. 

Example: 

$2100 Computer, interest is 15%. If I paid at the end of that month, I would have $2,415. Then interest I would’ve paid would be $315. However, they would distribute that payment over the course of the month. 

So, instead of paying one month after my purchase, and I paid 15 days after. I would be paying off my product along with $157.50 since they incur interest daily. 

TLDR; I’m going to save now and pay later. I’ll start looking for a computer once I have enough money saved up.","[1750.0, 1000.0, 2100.0, 2415.0, 315.0, 157.5]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/158x9zv/should_i_get_affirm_for_my_new_gaming_pc/

I'm so lost and confused, and blaming myself heavily for doing this to myself. I can't talk to my friends about it because this is WAY too embarrassing (and I have this one friend who sometimes tells me he has a problem, which is having too much money and not knowing what to do with it - I told him to go enjoy life - which is the kindest way I can tell him to go fuck right off - and then I feel depressed and miserable that I'm in this situation). Which makes me feel immature for feeling that way, and that makes me more depressed. It's such a vicious cycle that I can't take it anymore. I started reading the book ""Your money or your life"" and a book title has never hit me harder.

I know need a side hustle and the only one I can think of is being a Doordash / Uber food delivery person (or take up a job on the weekends or both? I don't know where I can find weekend only gigs though). My car is a 2 seater Miata so I can't Lyft/Uber. 

[It feels like what I need is the help of a financial planner but I can't afford one, clearly. So that's why I'm here.](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201448/rs_500x220-140508105809-tumblr_mf6wvtEUVE1r6w7e0o1_500_large.gif)


.... it's 2:25am PST on Xmas Day. I'm so depressed financially it feels like my post is going to sink the bottom and never get any real / substantial help in planning for my future. If that's the case I hope a repost won't have horrible consequences :). Also I feel like nobody would want to be with me (I started seeing someone and I care for them a lot), which is why planning for my future is now the only thing I care about.

**EDIT**: ... it's 9:15am and I just woke up to shitloads of comments! I'm completely overwhelmed by the support and response, and it will take me some time to grok everything. The amount of support makes me feel like this is not an unsurmountable challenge, which is the best I can ask for at this point. Also /u/ironicosity - I was just sleeping (I posted this and went to bed at 2:30am or later), so I'm sorry I didn't partake in the discussion until now. I'll try to acknowledge comments individually now that I'm awake. Some quick updates though:

**RENT:** I live in the South Bay in a rent controlled area so moving isn't particularly the best option for me. I'd rather cut my expenses somewhere else, and I can probably get someone to move in with me by March after I donate / sell just about everything I don't need (a laptop, some books, and basic cookware is all I absolutely require).

**SUBSCRIPTIONS:** I have cancelled all of the subscriptions I can think of except what is noted above. I'm willing to cut out everything but AMC - my date and I are super avid movie buffs and I watch 3 movies a week on a consistent basis, and I don't buy anything from concessions. Outside of hanging out with people it's really the only thing I look forward to.

**CAR:** I think it would be absolutely stupid to get rid of it. If I were in SF I'd get rid of it in a heartbeat but where I live I find it impossible to get anything done without a car. I used to do it and everything took at least an hour longer. It takes me places that I need to get to and I'd rather use it to get some more money on the side, especially since it's almost paid off. I got it used for 10K with 30K miles on it so it'll serve me well for the next 5 years easy.

Obligatory thanks for the gold, stranger! Of all my years lurking, this is what gets me gold, haha. Thanks again, whoever you are!

t5_2qstm,"Bought a house in June 2022, now the city wants to buy up the houses in the neighborhood.","Bought a house in June 2022, now the city wants to buy up the houses in the neighborhood. To try and make a long story short, the wife and I bought a house in June 2022, moved in a month later, and now the city wants to buy up all the houses in our neighborhood to tear down and sell to developers in the near future.

Possibly relevant info: Mortgage info: $150,000 financed (no down payment) with a VA loan, bought points to lower our interest rate, ended up at 3.875%. With home and flood insurance and other taxes escrowed, we are looking at about $1030/month payments.

The limited info we have from the city so far is that they are expected to pay a fair price (Zillow estimate is $164K) and will cover closing costs and costs of moving. We may be able to go ahead and sell but still have upwards of a year (or slightly longer) before we have to move.

My biggest concern is if we go ahead and sell this close to initially purchasing we'll be hit with a big tax liability on the sale price being more than the mortgage, which we will really need to get relocated.

Other notes: We have been considering moving out of state. Our current home is really close to two big construction projects, the widening of the main road we live off of to a four lane, and a new outlet mall being constructed a mile away.

&#x200B;

What questions should I ask of both the city and my current lender, and what do you think our first steps should be in all of this?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: They have offered us $195K for the house. I'm concerned that between moving costs and the costs associated with finding a new home, we will end up paying more than that with the new interest rate even after buying additional percentage points and/or a down payment. They are offering to let us live in the house rent-free for a year, only paying utilities and carrying renters insurance on the home.","[150000.0, 1030.0, 164.0, 195.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/113w6nx/bought_a_house_in_june_2022_now_the_city_wants_to/

Now I need a new car","Took Ramsey's advice, ended up buying a cheap car that cost THOUSANDS in repairs with more on the way. Now I need a new car I took Ramseys advice that a car should be paid for in cash. I agreed with this because I hate being in debt (my credit cards are paid in full every month, $0 in debt). 

At the beginning of this year, I paid for a car outright for $3500 off Craigslist. Even had a mechanic friend look it over to give me the go ahead. 

Not even A YEAR LATER, and I've spent THOUSANDS on repairs for this car. The worst part is the clutch started to slip along with major leaks. I've already spent around $2,000 on repairs. These next 2 repairs alone will cost more than I paid for the car. Every day I worry whether the car will turn on or not. 

My first car was paid for outright and this same thing happened. Less than a year later, the repairs cost more than the car.  

I could have used all this money as a down payment on a car that was actually reliable. I'm sick of cheap, high-mileage cars, but I hate being in debt. I don't know what to do. I've had car payments I couldn't afford once and I never want to experience that again. For a reliable car on the low-end it looks like it'll be <$25,000.

t5_2qstm,"Considering buying a home, but my SO doesn't like the idea of paying towards a mortgage on a house she doesn't own. Advice?","Considering buying a home, but my SO doesn't like the idea of paying towards a mortgage on a house she doesn't own. Advice? I'm 23, soon to be 24. I've saved up roughly $25,000 in the past two years, and am considering buying a home. I've been in a relationship with my SO for over 5 years now, and we've now lived together just over 1 year of that. We've talked about the idea of buying a home casually (we rent right now).

She mentioned our ideas to her mother (a lawyer), who offered to write up a purchase agreement between the two of us, in regards to what happens to the property if one of us dies, we split up, or something else.

When my SO told me this, I was against the idea. I told her that if I purchased a house, I would want to purchase it in my name only. I care deeply about my SO, but we're not married, and while the idea of marriage has come up, we both don't feel comfortable getting married so young, regardless of how long we've been together.

She (understandably) was somewhat offended that I wouldn't want to purchase a home in both our names, and her feelings are that she ""wouldn't want to pay a mortgage towards a home she doesn't own."" Which of course makes sense! But I explained that if I were to buy a home, assuming she would want to live with me, as we do now, that I would charge her a very reasonable rent (no more than half the mortgage payment), along with splitting the bills, as we do now.

We would be able to move out of our small apartment, and into a private home, with a fenced yard, garage, etc. So in my eyes, she's getting a great deal, as we couldn't feasibly afford the cost of renting an equivalent home right now, and I would charge her no more than half of the mortgage (roughly $300-$400/month).

While I definitely sympathize with her, in that she doesn't want to pay towards a home she doesn't own, I can't help but feel a little frustrated. She couldn't purchase a home on her own to begin with, so for her, it's a free upgrade. She would be paying the same rent, but would get an awesome home and yard!

And just for fun, let's say I purchased a home, and she *didn't* want to live with me. I have plenty of friends who would jump on the chance to rent a room in a nice home for a few hundred dollars a month.

It comes down to the fact that I'm only (almost) 24 years old. While I am committed and happy in our relationship, marriage is a far-and-away concept. I don't mean to be pessimistic about our relationship, but I'm trying to make the best long-term decision for **me** right now. I *do not* want to have deal with divvying up the property if we were to break up.

I feel terrible, because I know she thinks I'm questioning the strength of our relationship, along with all the other thoughts that would come along with your SO not wanting to purchase a home with you... But I want to protect myself and my investment. And this isn't to say we won't get married later in life, because we just might! But for ***right now***, I don't think it's a good idea to purchase a home together.

So, should I forgo the idea of purchasing a home until I am committed enough that I would purchase it with my SO? Am I being an asshole for thinking this way? Did you purchase your first home with your SO, or alone? What advise do you have for me (us).

Thanks for your time and insight!

t5_2qstm,Considering leaving my job and would owe ~$20k in tuition to my employer. Pay it off now or take a loan?,"Considering leaving my job and would owe ~$20k in tuition to my employer. Pay it off now or take a loan? As the title says, I’m considering leaving my job and would owe my employer about $20k in tuition as part of my employee agreement (they paid for my masters and I’d need to pay back tuition from the last year). I have the money in the bank but am considering taking a personal loan to not take as big of a hit to my bank account. I’m also looking to buy a house in the next few years and would like to see it go towards a down payment. 

The new job would pay roughly the same as I make now but allow for more flexibility/benefits/work-life balance than what I get now.

Edit: current salary of 115k/yr, 90k in the bank, no debt, would need to stay until January for $14k of it to be forgiven, and then May of 2024 for the remaining $6k. The main benefits of the new job are that it a) would bring me into a different engineering industry which I actually want to work in, and b) its a hybrid role so I’d be able to work from home (which my current job doesn’t allow). My current company is poorly managed and every (and I mean EVERY) task that’s assigned is months behind with management pressure to work harder to fix it.

Edit 2: for those asking, my job isn’t *that* bad. It’s tolerable in that I could wait the few months for the debt to be forgiven, but I’m more concerned that the new position won’t be available then. I haven’t seen many positions in my area similar to it and I’d want to jump on it while there’s one out there. The new company said it’s for an immediate hire to expand their team so I suspect they’d go with someone sooner rather than later.","[20.0, 20.0, 14.0, 6.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wuti0e/considering_leaving_my_job_and_would_owe_20k_in/
t5_2qstm,My Experience with a Timeshare (Wyndham) Sales Team in Vegas,"My Experience with a Timeshare (Wyndham) Sales Team in Vegas I'm writing this because the Reddit threads on this topic are outdated and more people should know what I now know about the ""new"" timeshares. This is what it's like to be on the receiving end of a Wyndham timeshare sales pitch. Here goes:


I vaguely knew what I was getting in to. My girlfriend and I arrived at an MGM owned casino. We get a bite to eat and as soon as we began our exploration of the Casino someone approached us offering vouchers for free play in the casino worth $75. I'm usually hesitant to ever get sucked into something like this but my girlfriend insisted that we do it. ""They give it to you for showing up, we'll just say no, I've got friends who did this too, etc."" I went along and decided to keep an open mind about it.


We talk to this guy who convinces people to attend this ""seminar"" for two hours and you'll receive the vouchers, plus a hotel room for a few nights from a selection of locations, plus free breakfast. He insists that all you need to do is say ""no, not interested"" once the 2 hours are up and you can just leave with your vouchers. Obviously his incentive isn't to sell anything but fill the buses with as many people as possible.


The next day we get on the bus to the seminar location. My initial thought was that we'd all crowd into a room and watch some presentation before given the opportunity to bounce. I was caught off guard when every couple was assigned a salesperson. We meet our salesman and he immediately compliments us, is incredibly impressed by any of the words we string together, and has now become our fake best friend.


We go into the presentation and the speaker does his thing. And everyone here should be aware that much of what he said was true, but his conclusions were abhorrent. He pointed out that in America we do not use all of our vacation days. We tend to waste them. We are also constantly putting off that one trip to our dream destination to ""someday"", but ""someday"" never comes. Next, he points out that most people, dying people, regret working so much and wish they spent more time with their families. These are true facts. 


But then he concluded by suggesting we should all buy into this program which will allow us to take these dream vacations. It was the kind of sound financial advice you'd expect from someone who would directly benefit from the purchase and would never hear from you again.


I want to note, the speaker was talented and entertaining. He was loaded with jokes, self-deprecating humor. It was funny, but holy shit. Looking around the room were the salespeople with the obnoxious fake laughter. They saw this probably a hundred times. It was creepy. It was surreal. 1/3 of the audience was in on the sales pitch. 


The salespeople used every joke as an opportunity to measure the responses on the faces on their paired couple. The speaker would crack a joke and all the sales people would simultaneously throw their back out laughing before turning to the couple they were with to see if they were laughing too. 


There were no opportunities for me to speak with my girlfriend without the salesman eavesdropping. The presentation moved fast enough that looking anything up seemed like too much of a distraction. As skilled as they seemed at controlling my behavior, the whole thing was throwing up red flags.


Anyway, the presentation ended and our salesman led us to a table. On the way over there were other couples sitting out in the open with their assigned salesperson. They seemed excited about what they were hearing and excitedly signing papers. It was...weird.


We sit down and the salesman goes through the program in more detail. Here's where I get genuinely turned off. I work in IT, I'm about to finish my bachelor's degree, I don't think I'm a sucker but my love of science puts me at odds with a person who's giving me overwhelmingly biased information. He reiterates all of the great things about this program. He turns to my girlfriend, ""what do you think about that?"" ""It sounds great!"" Then he turns to me. ""And what do you think about that? Is it something you'd want to do?"" And I reply ""Depending on the cost, yes, I'd do it!""


Next, he has us estimate the cost of a hotel we normally pay for. Then he asks us how many vacation days we take per year. This is fine and easy math. If the average cost is $115 per night, and you take 10 days, it's $1,150 per year in hotel costs. The ""program"" (timeshare but they completely avoid the term) lasts 20 years. It's still vague at this part but the salesman insists on focusing on how much we are gonna pay for these hotel rooms over the next 20 years.


Cost per year multiplied by 20 years is 23,000. But that's ***not*** the equation they're doing. They're not accounting for interest! Ah! It would be more over that time! How much does it really cost? About $250,000. They estimate that the hospitality industry has an inflation rate of 11%!! Everyone should have it ingrained in their heads that inflation across the entire economy (in America) has been around 3% per year. 


He was willing to tinker with the numbers but, generally speaking, we're spending a fuck ton of money on just hotels according to their calculations. And any close observers would note that the number **should have been much lower**. $1,300×20 years×1.1^20 = $174,914.99. I could have been wrong in my calculation but their cost estimate was obscenely high.


Disclaimer: As several people pointed out, some of that math is off and I used the incorrect equation (this does not change the conclusions). Here is a better description from a more qualified redditor /u/mowscut:

>As an actuary, both yours and their calculators bothered me. No idea where 250k comes from, but your calculation assumes you’re paying the fully inflated price (in 20 years) for every payment. The full value is a simple future value of annuity certain formula which is P[(1+i)n -1]/i where i is the interest, n the number of payments and P the payment amount. This gives 1,300(1.120 -1)/.11~83,000. Which is also a crazy number, but formulaically appropriate.


Then he asks if we have any more questions. Uh, yeah, how much are we talking about here? They never mentioned up to this point how much it costs! But I'm skeptical and the questions I'm asking are things like how do you actually book a vacation? What happens if I change my mind about it? Is it transferrable? The salesman doesn't know the answers to these questions so a higher level salesman comes over. He's very happy to meet us. He loves the outfit I'm wearing. He compliments various other features and, with the limited amount of information I've provided, seems completely ready to compete with the other salesman for the title of my new best friend.


He answers some of my questions but can't provide any documentation to back up his claims. They still won't provide a price but they hand an iPad to my girlfriend to start filling out personal information. I look over and as soon as I see there's a field for the social security number I damn near slap it out of her hands. They were literally going to do a credit check to see how much the cost would be for us! Huge red flag for me. First, the inquiry shows up on your credit report. While that may not be so bad, I want to be informed on making a purchase and at least know a price range before taking that kind of step.


This throws the salesman off. Apparently, no one stops at this part of the process. The head sales guy says it's fine, and offers for us to check out a room which would be the type of room we'd be staying in if we join this program. *I still don't know how much this program costs*. We go and the salesman leaves my girlfriend and I alone to explore at our own pace. 


This is where I frantically looked for the Reddit thread where personal finance gurus say ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE, THEY KIDNAP REDDITORS LIKE YOU AND YOUR CLONE BECOMES A SALESMAN"". I found a few threads, and they did warn against this, but they were at least a year old and it didn't all seem timely.


I couldn't find costs online either, so I thought to myself ""how much per month would I be willing to pay for something like this?"" I concluded $45 per month. But I still had misgivings about making a big commitment on such short notice when I couldn't even read anything like a contract. I'd rather go home and read independent reviews so I can be confident in my decision. I couldn't get to that point.


Once again we end up back at the table but this time the salesman has a laminated piece of paper with prices on it! I immediately I see huge numbers and realize why they waited so long to show it. They wanted approximately $130,000 for the total program. It would be $13,000 down to get started, and almost $500 per month. 

(Note: when I did the math later, the actual cost we'd likely pay is around what they wanted for the program. But we'd be paying a fortune upfront and have a monthly payment. We could only go to where Wyndham had properties, which was in America or Australia or some islands, but if we wanted to go to Europe it would be through RCI, which cost about $300 per week. That's about the cost of an AirBnB in some locations, so if you're a smart traveller it may not be worth it at all.)


""Would you rather pay this?"" The head salesman circles the $174,000. ""Or this"", he circles the $130,000. Ooga not want pay big number when ooga pay small number instead. I didn't want it. $45 dollars was as high as I'd go.


This is the part where they tried to pit my girlfriend against me in an amateurish attempt at manipulation. First, they go through the list of everything we ever told them about what we liked about the program (before we ever heard a price). They even sneak in a ""you should be willing to sacrifice something for it"" and gave a few examples like eating out less or having fewer cups of coffee from Starbucks. So I'm telling the salesman that this is way too expensive and once again the head sales guy shows up. He says things like ""I thought you said you liked the program? You said it was a 10/10. Are you saying it's not a 10/10? You said you'd be willing to sacrifice for this!"" He was getting irritated. Then he turned to my girlfriend and says ""it doesn't sound like he's as rich as he says he is"". At this point I was infuriated. Best friends don't say things like this to each other. But I held my cool. I looked him dead in the eye and firmly said ""I'm gonna pass"". 


But damn, the manipulation didn't stop and they didn't give up. They leave us alone to fill out a brief survey with a guy who definitely doesn't sell anything. So this guy shows up, introduces himself, and asks us about why we didn't buy it. I was truthful, it was too expensive and I wasn't willing to spend all that for it. I also felt pressured to make a big commitment on something that hours earlier I knew nothing about. So then he offers to sell us a ""trial"" program. It's a fraction of the price and it only lasts two years. It starts to be appealing, but then it is also limited to certain locations. I ask to see the contract and the guy says ""what do you want me to do, sit here and read you a contract""? At that point he gets frustrated and offers to walk us to the exit. It had been 4 hours. We get our vouchers and leave.

Tl;dr: it would have been a bad financial decision.

4 short years later and married with a baby girl, I find myself with $16,000 in credit card debt. I actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck. And when I say last dollar I truly mean it. We had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards. 

Less than two years later, we now have $16,000 in savings and no credit card debt. (We finance one of our cars) 

Credit card debt is crippling. My dad calls it the ULTIMATE SLAVEMASTER. It forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life. 

Here’s my list and I hope it helps you. I’m no guru, I just learned the hard way. 

1. You will not pay it off later. When ‘later’ comes, you’ll be buying other things to pay off later. 

2. Read Dave Ramsey’s money makeover. It’s got good tips and the tactics work. 

3. The Jones’ can suck it. They’re miserable and controlled by debt also. Don’t buy things you don’t need to compete with people you don’t care for anyways. 

4. Pick up a side hustle. I taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. My wife picked up Birth photography 

5. Talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. 

6. Be a bitch about your budget. Set it and don’t stray from it. 

7. Put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. Seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 CC debt. Not sure if it legit made a difference but I think it might’ve 

8. Become emotionless toward money. I would get so pissed that I was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. It was only till I stopped giving a f#&@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. 

9. Save nothing until it’s paid off. It doesn’t make sense to save money when you have CC debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. 

10. When in doubt... overpay. If you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the CC for 50 bucks. Keep basically nothing in your bank account because “you spend what you have.” My family could live off of $75 a week. But if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. So I would always put as much as made sense. A few times I overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. 

11. Unsave your cards on Amazon. So if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. 

These are just some of the silly things I picked up along the way that I think would’ve helped me stay out of the mess. We are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. I hope this helped!

t5_2qstm,Buying a house costs more than just a down payment.,"Buying a house costs more than just a down payment. EDIT: Wow, this got *way* more attention than I expected it to. To everyone who has congratulated us, sincerely, thank you. But there's been a good bit of negativity because, and I recognize this, the home we're buying is unique and has unique costs. We wanted an older home and we knew that there would be unexpected expenses going into this, which we prepared for. This is also part of why we went with a lower down payment; so that we had more money left over for required maintenance.

I think that [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/po7d9z/buying_a_house_costs_more_than_just_a_down_payment/hcvfylq/) really got to the heart of what I wanted to express so I wanted to feature it here:

> Looks like people are picking the story apart. They're missing the point. The cost of purchasing a house is a lot higher than just the down payment and there's a lot of unexpected things that can come up. It doesn't matter if your brother is a roofer or you have a friend who is a building inspector etc etc. There will always be things that your insurance, your hoa, or your survival require getting fixed.

For everyone who paid 1.2k down for their VA / FHA loan and has had absolutely no maintenance issues, there's someone who put 20% down to buy a newish home and had to eat $20k in unexpected repairs within the first 3 months. Basically...buying a house *can easily* cost more than just your down payment, and you should be prepared for it to, and be pleasantly surprised when it doesn't.

----


I'm sure most of this is known to many here, but my wife and I are about to close on our first house and I thought I would write up some of the process and costs here (mostly to solidify it in my head, tbh).

We offered 305K on an asking price of 299K on a home in a small rural village in Vermont.

Initial deposit / earnest money - $2000 (goes towards closing)

Upon our offer being accepted, we needed to put down a deposit to show we had ""skin in the game""; basically to keep us honest. It would have been refundable if we pulled out of the sale for a ""valid"" reason, which included things like failure to obtain funding / homeowner's insurance, or just finding the house wasn't to our liking after getting inspectors in. This deposit ultimately went towards closing costs.

Buyer’s Inspection - ~~$1200~~ $906

We bought an old house (built 1870) so there was no chance of us waiving the inspection / contingency period. We basically had two weeks to get a bunch of people in to look at the place and tell us all of the awful maintenance nightmares waiting for us in the home. Fortunately, ours was pretty good. They built them pretty solid back then.

The home’s water comes from a private well, and we wanted to test it for contaminants before we agreed. We also suspected lead paint on the home’s exterior so we wanted to make sure if there was lead, it wasn’t leaching into the water.

EDIT: So many people were yelling at me about the inspection I looked back and realized three things:

 - I had the initial amount wrong; I was charged $1106, not $1200.
 - The inspection also included the well water test (plus an inspection of the well / wellhouse and the attached 1200 sq ft barn), I listed it here separately
 - They based the inspection cost on google imagery which included a standing structure which was no longer there and charged me an extra $200 for that. When we got there and he realized they charged me for a structure which wasn't there, they refunded that.

So the actual cost here was

Inspection - $781  

Well Water Test - $125


Septic Inspection - $450

We had a dedicated septic inspector come over to take a look, because the septic is old (from the mid ‘80s) and in a weird spot, with a couple of large trees nearby. We wanted to make sure it was in working order and that it would be replaceable and that it wasn’t damaged by tree roots.

Lead Paint Test - $400

We also had a painter come by to check to see if the exterior paint is lead-based. We probably could have done this ourselves but he took multiple samples and I trust his results - seemed worth it for something which could be serious.

Total cost to this point - $4175

At this point, we’d spent over 2k on inspectors, and a LOT of time communicating with and coordinating their visits with the seller, plus agonizing a bit over the results of the inspections. Don’t count this out - it was several days worth of time overall where I struggled to focus on anything else. This is mostly money which would have been lost if at this point we decided to pull out. (if we weren’t able to afford / didn’t want to do the needed repairs which were brought to light by the inspections, then you could also consider this money spent as a small up front cost to keep our money later on.)

Anyway, we decided to go ahead with it because we love the house and have the time and money to spend working on it, and it seemed worth it because we plan to live there for at least 20 years. We are both 30.

Homeowner’s Insurance - $1400/yr (first year up front at closing)

The next item was homeowner’s insurance. I contacted an agent and got some *really* good quotes (~$700 /yr). Then they went to go see the place and went running. The home has an attached barn and the roof is a bit rusty; they wouldn’t insure it unless

 - We could get in a contractor to give us an assessment on it; whether it needs to be replaced or just some paint
 - The assessment suggested all it needed was paint
 - We could get the paint done before the winter

Right now roofing contractors in our area are SWAMPED. I called three different ones and none of them could even get to us to give us an assessment in time for closing. So, we backtracked a bit and contacted the agent currently insuring the home. She was able to help us, but the insurance costs twice as much as before ($1400) and they also stipulated that the barn roof be painted (just painted, though) and that the home’s exterior itself be painted in the first year of residence.

Homeowner’s came down to the wire; I started just after we got our initial disclosures and it wasn’t until just before labor day that I got this hammered out. Don’t put this off.

Barn Roof Paint - $4800

So, cue up the painters. I got three quotes and went with the middle one to repaint. Plus, he just seemed like a nice guy. I live in a rural area which doesn't have a lot of shysters so I’m apt to go with my gut on people.

Exterior paint - ~$10,000

I haven’t gotten any official quotes yet. I’m going to get one from the guy painting the barn roof and a couple more after that, but he gave me an “estimate” and he ballparked around 10k.

Closing costs: $13,683

Down Payment: $9,150 (yes yes, very low, I know.)

Cash to Close: $22,833


Closing costs include 1/yr payment of insurance premium up front, taxes, title lawyer, yadda yadda. Even with a very low down payment, we still owe more than double that up front to pay for closing, and that’s once again not including the inspections and the requirements from our homeowners. In total, our full cost to get to this point in the process is

Total Cost - $27,008

Total Cost including currently known required work - $41,808

There's some other work in our peripherals; the kitchen sink needs replacing, the bathroom floor needs replacing as well, and some other smaller things, which we estimate will add another 5-7k of cost. I suspect that in the long run, the sky's the limit in terms of cost. ;)

And this isn’t even including incidental things like:

 - Buying new / more furniture for a larger space (we desperately need a new bed - $1500 alone)
 - Buying a lawn mower / snow blower / snow rake / chainsaw / other tools
 - heating oil costs (~3-4k a year where we live)
 - paying for cleaners for our old apt (~$400)
 - Renting a uhaul for a couple of days (~$250)
 - Increased payment due to property tax re-assessment (rather high where we live)
 - And any number of things I haven’t even thought of yet.

Anyway, the whole point of this post is that many times in the past several years I’ve thought to myself, “hm, I have enough money for a down payment on a house! I should buy one!” and had I tried before we were in a more confident financial position, it definitely would have ended in tears and anxiety.

t5_2qstm,"Seriously, get and use a credit card","Seriously, get and use a credit card I've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. There are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. That's all. There are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. Here are a few:

**It's safer!** When you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. Should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. Yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.

Compare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. You have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. And if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. 

**It builds your credit.** When you use a credit card RESPONSIBLY, it will build your credit over time. Which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. Low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. Compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.

The caveat here is that you never miss a payment. EVER. A good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. You should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.

**Purchase protection.** A lot of major credit card companies (like American Express and Discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. This is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen TV or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. Some features are:

* Accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.
* Better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? The credit card company will cover the difference.
* Theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you
* Extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iPhone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. 

And many more.

**The credit card company will reward you for using it.** Most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. Same applies for paying bills. So by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.

Some tips on using a credit card: 

* NEVER miss a payment. EVER. You will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.
* Only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. This is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. Being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.
* Pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. When you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. Whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. Paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.

Hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. They're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.

Here's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. A couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. The purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. My bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. All I had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. Never had to deal with it again. Granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.

I applied for my first credit card the day I turned 18. I now have seven credit cards with over $100,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 819 at a young age. All it took was a little persistence and responsibility. If I can do it, believe me, so can you.

t5_2qstm,I'm 32 and broke. I finally made my first budget ever and I'm -$700 in the hole every month. What do I do?,"I'm 32 and broke. I finally made my first budget ever and I'm -$700 in the hole every month. What do I do? So, I've never had a lot of money, but I lost my full time job this past April and I'm now working part time at a bank while also attending college during the day, 3 days per week.  I make about $250 per week.  My grandma gives me $400 per month to help with my rent.  I know, I'm pathetic.

I've been having to borrow a lot of money from my parents, and it's been pretty shitty, so I broke down and finally added up all my expenses and income, and I make about $700 less than I need to just to break even.  I check on Indeed pretty much every day to see if I can get a second job, but the job market in my area is really bad, and I'm also kind of limited by my school schedule as to which hours I can work.  Dropping out is not an option - I'm a semester and a half away from my Bachelor's.

My rent is $600 and I am probably moving soon, in with my brother, which should cut that almost in half.  I did notice that I spend a lot of money on food - like $400 per month.  I don't eat out very often but I do cook a lot and I literally never check prices when I'm grocery shopping, I just get what I need for the recipe. So that's an area of opportunity.

But even if I cut both my rent and my grocery shopping in half, I'd still be in the hole.  I have about 4 credit cards all with low limits (the highest is $650) but they're all maxed out and I pay about $130 monthly for them, just minimum payments. My credit sucks.  I would get a debt consolidation loan for them (they all have high rates, like 24%) but I almost certainly will not be approved for any kind of loan based on my DTI and my credit score.

I'm overwhelmed by all of this.  I'd like to start digging myself out of this hole but I have no idea where to start.

The e bike I’m looking at with all the features I am including is almost $3k, and while I have that amount to just drop on a bike, would it be smarter to go on a BNPL with it. I know I can easily afford it but rather than dropping all of $3k, I pay a monthly payment and leave what I would’ve spend in a HYSA. And once ive reached a comfortable number (not sure what that number is yet) then pay it outright.

I don’t plan on touching my HYSA for anything much really.

Purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  What I discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was ANXIETY followed by uncertainty.  In this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  I will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 The worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  This is called buyer’s remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  Why? Well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. I do not want this happen to you!  The following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ Emotional Manipulation

During my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  One is emotional manipulation.  The reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  “Ma’am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  Go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.”  Is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  You are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  That awesome new car smell isn’t helping either is it?  That feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  They are counting on you to feel this way. 

What happens next is quite primitive.  As our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. When this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  Have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  I had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. RIP Bootsy.  During these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  In this case fear dictated my dog’s behaviors.  Much like my old boy Bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  The budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**How to overcome trick #1 “Emotional Manipulation”**

Be mindful of your emotions.  Simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  I always recommend that we sleep on it.  My rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  This isn’t the same as picking up a Snickers while in the checkout line. This is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. Be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ Pushing you towards Payments

After the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  Car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  This has two benefits for them.  1) Making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  We end up paying more this way. (See Ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) The interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  The payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  Over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6K to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  See below how Customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  This is worth repeating...A $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**How to overcome #2 “Pushing you towards payments”**

Tell the salesman up front “I am not interested in going over payments right now, let’s stick to the price of the car out the door.”  You must be proactive here.  A skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of “well ma’am, I just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget”.  Just smile at your new adversary and politely say “While I appreciate your concern, I have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price”.  (Make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). They will get the picture.  You want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  You have now become a formidable opponent.  You have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (See Ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   Also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  Better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ The Finance Office

After a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  Here you meet the Finance Manager.  This person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  This is where even the toughest buyers lose.  Why? They lose because their guard is down.  When we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  Usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   You give out a big sigh of relief.  In my sales days, I will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. He knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  He clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (Nice job!). What happened next really opened my eyes.  He ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and GAP products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in Example 3)  All of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  Customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  Don’t let this happen to you.  Being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
I want you to know the background of the Finance Managers and how they get that job.  It’s not by going to business school and majoring in Finance.  They get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  That is part of the car sales business ladder.  It takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  You can’t put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. Therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  They are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

The first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  Let’s nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  He has one clear goal.  Convince us to buy what he has.  He doesn’t make as much money otherwise.  He will once again show us the NEW payments if we were to purchase products A, B, or C.  They make money in 2 ways.  The first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  They borrow your loan money from Bank A for 3% and charge you 4%.  The dealership gets a part of that and the Finance Manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  See Ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   The second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**How to overcome #3 “The Finance Office”**

As before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  It really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. I personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  Don’t let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  Be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  The convenience is worth it for some.  (See example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  Next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
Good luck!  I hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  I hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.   
 
 
**Example1**

 We are purchasing a $25,000 car.  Let’s say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
The salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. “Which one works better for you sir?”  Do you see what he did there?  He changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from HIS two options.  Many people lose here. They say they like one of the payments and lose OR they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  The salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (They always come back higher).  Great. Car is sold.  Let’s do the math though.  You wanted to be at $22,000.  By accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle AND you have no idea what the interest rate is.  The lesson here: Keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  When that is settled THEN work on payments. 
 
**Example 2**

A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ You will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ You will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
That is a difference of $720
Know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**Example 3**

Be familiar with the products BEFORE you go into the finance office.
 
GAP Insurance:  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-gap-insurance-is-it-right-for-you.aspx
Extended Warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
The $4500 example above was many years ago. Competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  Still, do your homework and check around. Credit Unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  Companies like State Farm Insurance now do auto financing and will give you GAP for FREE if you finance through them!  My credit union charges $349 for GAP. Dealerships charge $750 and above.  I hope you can appreciate the value.

t5_2qstm,Crypto-Currency: A Guide to Common Tax Situations,"Crypto-Currency: A Guide to Common Tax Situations STATUS: Majority of questions have been answered. If yours got missed, please feel free to post it again.

**Introduction**

All,

Based on the rapid increase in popularity and price of bitcoin and other crypto currencies (particularly over the past year), I expect that lots of people have questions about how crypto currency will impact their taxes. This thread attempts to address several common issues. I'm posting similar versions of it here, in several major crypto subs, and eventually in the weekly ""tax help"" threads r/personalfinance runs.

I'd like to thank the /r/personalfinance mod team and the /r/tax community for their help with this thread and especially for reading earlier versions and offering several valuable suggestions/corrections.

**This thread is NOT an endorsement of crypto currency as an investing strategy**. There is a time and a place to debate the appropriateness of crypto as part of a diversified portfolio - but that time is not now and that place is not here. If you are interested in the general consensus of this sub on investing, I would urge you to consult [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_investing) while keeping in mind the [general flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) outlining basic steps to get your finances in order.

Finally, please note that this thread attempts to provide information about your tax obligations as defined by United States law (and interpreted by the IRS under the direction of the Treasury Department). I understand that a certain portion of the crypto community tends to view crypto as ""tax free"" due to the (actual and perceived) difficulty for the IRS to ""know"" about the transactions involved. I **will not** discuss unlawfully concealing crypto gains here nor will I suggest illegal tax avoidance activities.

**The Basics**

This section is best for people that don't understand much about taxes. It covers some very basic tax principles. It also assumes that all you did during the year was buy/sell a single crypto currency.

Fundamentally, the IRS treats crypto not as money, but as an asset (investment). While there are a few specific ""twists"" when it comes to crypto, when in doubt replace the word ""crypto"" with the word ""stock"" and you will get a pretty good idea how you should report and pay tax on crypto.

The first thing you should know is that the majority of this discussion applies to the taxes you are currently working on (2017 taxes). The tax bill that just passed applies to 2018 taxes (with a few very tiny exceptions), which most people will file in early 2019.
 
In general, you don't have to report or pay taxes on crypto currency holdings until you ""cash out"" all or part of your holdings. For now, I'm going to assume that you cash out by selling them for USD; however, other forms of cashing out will be covered later.

When you sell crypto, you report the difference between your basis (purchase price) and proceeds (sale price) on Schedule D. Your purchase price is commonly referred to as your basis; while the two terms don't mean exactly the same thing, they are pretty close to one another (in particular, there are ~~three~~ two ways to calculate your basis - ~~your average cost~~, a first-in, first-out method, and a ""specific identification"" method. See more about these [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Cost_basis_methods#Changing_methods) and [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/methods)). **EDIT** - you may not use average cost method with crypto - [see here](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#en_US_201612_publink1000256905). If you sell at a gain, this gain increases your tax liability; if you sell at a loss, this loss decreases your tax liability (in most cases). If you sell multiple times during the year, *you report each transaction separately* (bad news if you trade often) but get to lump all your gains/losses together when determining how the trades impact your income.

One important thing to remember is that there are two different types of gains/losses from investments - short term gains (if you held an asset for one year or less) and long term gains (over one year; i.e. one year and one day). Short term gains are taxed at your marginal income rate (basically, just like if you had earned that money at a job) while long term gains are taxed at lower rates.

For most people, long term capital gains are taxed at 15%. However, if you are in the 10% or 15% tax bracket, congrats - your gains (up to the maximum amount of ""unused space"" in your bracket) are tax free! If you are in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 15%. If you are in the 39.6% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 20%. Additionally, there is an ""extra"" 3.8% tax that applies to gains for those above $200,000/$250,000 (single/married). The exact computation of this tax is a little complicated, but if you are close to the $200,000 level, just know that it exists.

Finally, you should know that I'm assuming that you should treat your crypto gains/losses as investment gains/losses. I'm sure some people will try and argue that they are really ""day traders"" of crypto and trade as a full time job. While this is possible, the vast majority of people don't qualify for this status and you should really think several times before deciding you want to try that approach on the IRS.

**""Cashing Out"" - Trading Crypto for Goods/Services**

I realize that not everyone that ""cashes out"" of crypto does so by selling it for USD. In fact, I understand that some in the crypto community view the necessity of cashing out itself as [a type of myth](https://imgur.com/gE8hDnY). In this section, I discuss what happens if you trade your crypto for basically anything that isn't cash (minor sidenote - see next section for a special discussion on trading crypto for crypto; i.e. buying altcoins with crypto).

The IRS views trading crypto for something of value as a type of bartering that must be included in income. From the IRS's perspective, it doesn't matter if you sold crypto for cash and bought a car with that cash or if you just traded crypto directly for the car - in both cases, the IRS views you as having sold your crypto. This approach isn't unique to crypto - it works the same way if you trade stock for something.

This means that if you do trade your crypto for ""stuff"", you have to report every exchange as a sale of your crypto and calculate the gain/loss on that sale, just as if you had sold the crypto for cash.

Finally, there is one important exception to this rule. If you give your crypto away to charity (one recognized by the IRS; like a 501(c)(3) organization), the IRS doesn't make you report/pay any capital gains on the transaction. Additionally, you still get to deduct the value of your donation on the date it was made. Now, from a ""selfish"" point of view, you will always end up with more money if you sell the crypto, pay the tax, and keep the rest. But, if you are going to make a donation anyway, especially a large one, giving crypto where you have a big unrealized/untaxed gain is a very efficient way of doing so.
___
**""Alt Coins"" - Buying Crypto with Crypto**

The previous section discusses what happens when you trade crypto for stuff. However, one thing that surprises many people is that trading crypto for crypto is also a taxable event, just like trading crypto for a car. Whether you agree with this position or not, it makes a lot of sense once you realize that the IRS doesn't view crypto as money, but instead as an asset. So to the IRS, trading bitcoin for ripple isn't like trading dollars for euros, but it is instead like trading shares of Apple stock for shares of Tesla stock.

Practically, what this means is that if you trade one crypto for another crypto (say BTC for XRP just to illustrate the point), the IRS views you as doing the following:

* Selling for cash the amount of BTC you actually traded for XRP.
* Owing capital gains/losses on the BTC based on its selling price (the fair market value at the moment of the exchange) and your purchase price (basis).
* Buying a new investment (XRP) with a cost basis equal to the amount the BTC was worth when you exchanged them.

This means that if you ""time"" your trade wrong and the value of XRP goes down after you make the exchange, you still owe tax on your BTC gain even though you subsequently lost money. The one good piece of news in this is that when/if you sell your XRP (or change it back to BTC), you will get a capital loss for the value that XRP dropped.

There is one final point worth discussing in this section - the so called ""like kind exchange"" rules (aka section 1031 exchange). At a high level, these rules say that you can ""swap"" property with someone else without having to pay taxes on the exchange as long as you get property in return that is ""like kind"". Typically, these rules are used in real estate transactions. However, they can also apply to other types of transactions as well.

While the idea is simple (and makes it sound like crypto for crypto should qualify), the exact rules/details of this exception are very fact specific. Most experts (including myself, but certainly not calling myself an expert) believe that a crypto for crypto swap **is not** a like kind exchange. The recently passed tax bill also explicitly clarifies this issue - starting in 2018, only real estate qualifies for like kind exchange treatment. So, basically, the vast majority of evidence suggests that you can't use this ""loophole"" for 2017; however, there is a small minority view/some small amount of belief that this treatment would work for 2017 taxes and it is worth noting that I'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this approach.
___
**Dealing with ""Forks""**

Perhaps another unpleasant surprise for crypto holders is that ""forks"" to create a new crypto also very likely generate a taxable event. The IRS has long (since at least the 1960s) held that ""found"" money is a taxable event. This approach has been litigated in court and courts have consistently upheld this position; it even has its own cool nerdy tax name - the ""treasure trove"" doctrine.

Practically, what this means is that if you owned BTC and it ""forked"" to create BCH, then the fair market value of the BCH you received is considered a ""treasure trove"" that must be reported as income (ordinary income - no capital gain rates). This is true whether or not you sold your BCH; if you got BCH from a fork, that is a taxable event (note - I'll continue using BTC forking to BCH in this section as an example, but the logic applies to all forks).

While everything I've discussed up to this point is pretty clearly established tax law, forks are really where things get messy with taxes. Thus, the remainder of this section contains more speculation than elsewhere in this post - the truth is that while the idea is simple (fork = free money = taxable), the details are messy and other kinds of tax treatment might apply to forks.

One basic practical problem with forks is that the new currency doesn't necessarily start trading immediately. Thus, you may have received BCH before there was a clear price or market for it. Basically, you owe tax on the value of BCH when you received it, but it isn't completely clear what that value was. There are several ways you can handle this; I'll list them in order from most accurate to least accurate (but note that this is just my personal view and there is ongoing disagreement on this issue with little/no authoritative guidance).

* Use a futures market to determine the value of the BCH - if reliable sources published realistic estimates of what BCH will trade for in the future once trading begins, use this estimate as the value of your BCH. Pros/cons - futures markets are, in theory, pretty accurate. However, if they are volatile/subject to manipulation, they may provide an incorrect estimate of the true value of BCH. It would suck to use the first futures value published only to have that value plummet shortly thereafter, leaving you to pay ordinary income tax but only have an unrealized capital loss.

* Wait until an exchange starts trading BCH; use the actual (""spot"" price) as the value. Pros/cons - spot prices certainly reflect what you could have sold BCH for; however, it is possible that the true value of the coin was higher/lower when you received it as compared to when it started trading on the exchange. Thus this method seems less accurate to me than a futures based approach, but it is still certainly fairly reasonable.

* Assume that the value is $0. This is my least preferred option, but there is still a case to be made for it. If you receive something that you didn't want, can't access, can't sell, and might fail, does it have any value? I believe the answer is yes (maybe not value it perfectly, but value it somewhat accurately), but if you honestly think the answer is no, then the correct tax answer would be to report $0 in income from the fork. The IRS would be most likely to disagree with this approach, especially since it results in the least amount of income reported for the current year (and the most favorable rates going forward). Accordingly, if you go this route, make extra sure you understand what it entails.

Note, once you've decided what to report as taxable income, this amount also becomes your cost basis in the new crypto (BCH). Thus, when you ultimately sell your BCH (or trade it for something else as described above), you calculate your gain/loss based on what you included in taxable income from the fork.

Finally, there is one more approach to dealing with forks worth mentioning. A fork ""feels"" a lot like a dividend - because you held BTC, you get BCH. In a stock world, if I get a cash dividend because I own the stock, that money **is not** treated as a ""treasure trove"" and subject to ordinary income rates - in most cases, it is a qualified dividend and subject to capital gain rates; in some cases, some types of stock dividends are completely non taxable. [This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/08/04/how-to-report-bitcoin-cash-and-avoid-irs-trouble/2/#6af873a0a1d2) discusses this idea in slightly more detail and generally concludes that forks should not be treated as a dividend. Still, I would note that I'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this theory.

Ultimately, this post is supposed to be practical, so let me make sure to leave you with two key thoughts about the taxation of forks. First, I believe that the majority of evidence suggests that forks should be treated as a ""treasure trove"" and reported as ordinary income based on their value at creation and that this is certainly the ""safest"" option. Second, out of everything discussed in this post, I also believe that the correct taxation of forks is the murkiest and most ""up for debate"" area. If you are interested in a more detailed discussion of forks, see [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/7p1kw6/draft_discussion_of_crypto_currency_and_taxes_for/) for a previous version of this post discussing it at even more length and the comments for a discussion of this with the r/tax community.

**Mining Crypto**

Successfully mining crypto coins is a taxable event. Depending on the amount of effort you put into mining, it is either considered a hobby or a self-employment (business) activity. The IRS provides the following list of questions to help decide the correct classification:

* The manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity.
* The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors. 
* The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity. 
* Expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in value.
* The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities.
* The taxpayer’s history of income or losses with respect to the activity.
* The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned.

If this still sounds complicated, that's because the distinction is subject to some amount of interpretation. As a rule of thumb, randomly mining crypto on an old computer is probably a hobby; mining full time on a custom rig is probably a business.

In either event, you must include in income the fair market value of any coins you successfully mine. These are ordinary income and your basis in these coins is their fair market value on the date they were mined. If your mining is a hobby, they go on line 21 (other income) and any expenses directly associated with mining go on schedule A (miscellaneous subject to 2% of AGI limitation). If your mining is a business, income and expenses go on schedule C.

Both approaches have pros and cons - hobby income isn't subject to the 15.3% self-employment tax, only normal income tax, but you get fewer deductions against your income and the deductions you get are less valuable. Business income has more deductions available, but you have to pay payroll (self-employment) tax of about 15.3% in addition to normal income tax.

**What if I didn't keep good records? Do I really have to report every transaction?**

One nice thing about the IRS treating crypto as an asset is that we can look at how the IRS treats people that ""day trade"" stock and often don't keep great records/have lots of transactions. While you need to be as accurate as possible, it is ok to estimate a little bit if you don't have exact records (especially concerning your cost basis). You need to put in some effort (research historical prices, etc...) and be reasonable, but the IRS would much rather you do a little bit of reasonable estimation as opposed to just not reporting anything. Sure, they might decide to audit you/disagree with some specifics, but you earn yourself a lot of credit if you can show that you honestly did the best you reasonably could and are making efforts to improve going forward.

However, concerning reporting every transaction - yes, sorry, it is clear that you have to do this, even if you made hundreds or thousands of them. Stock traders have had to go through this for many decades, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that the IRS would accept anything less from the crypto community. If you have the records or have any reasonable way of obtaining records/estimating them, you must report every transaction.
___
**What if I don't trust you?**

Well, first let me say that I can't believe you made it all the way down here to this section. Thanks for giving me an honest hearing. I would strongly encourage you to go read other well-written, honest guides. I'll link to some I like (both more technical IRS type guides and more crypto community driven guides). While a certain portion of the crypto community seems to view one of the benefits of crypto as avoiding all government regulation (including taxes), I've been pleasantly surprised to find that many crypto forums contain well reasoned, accurate tax guides. While I may not agree with 100% of their conclusions, that likely reflects true uncertainty around tax law that is fundamentally complex rather than an attempt on either end to help individuals unlawfully avoid taxes.

- Roommates are a popular way to save money on rent.  Be aware of the issues that can come up with roommates though, since circumstances change, and you may be on the hook for their share.  Have all roommates on the lease.  You might even want a [roommate agreement](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter6-2.html).  Perhaps Sheldon Cooper has it right after all?  Alternatively, consider renting a room from someone who owns their own house.

You can save a [lot of money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/) if you don't need to pay for one!   It's not just the purchase cost.  There's gas, repairs, and especially [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance), which is  [very expensive](http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/cheapest-minimum-liability-insurance.aspx) for young people, typically at least $100/month, and can even be $200/month in some places, or if you have a tickets / accidents. 

-  Your best bet if you do need a car is to save up $5000 or so for a [reliable used car](http://www.carsdirect.com/used-car-buying/best-5-reliable-used-car-models), then pay cash, so you can avoid finance charges and make your own insurance choices.  If you do need to finance a car, be very careful of financing offers for young people.  Double-digit interest rates are a Bad Thing.  You do not want to ""build credit"" that way! The loan and the car are different things.  You can't give back the car and be done with the loan, since you will typically be ""[underwater](http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/being-upside-down.html)"" and owe more than the car is worth.  

- Choose your spending wisely.  Money spent is unavailable for anything else. Make sure it was your highest priority use of that money.

I have been served lots of ads on Facebook, and sometimes it is so tempting to just order something because of the ""huge"" discount, but then I remind myself that unless I really need something, my savings is 100% if I don't make that purchase. Also, be careful with those 0% financing deals. I saw that Tonal (smart home gym) priced their product at $2,750 for a normal purchase, but if you want 36 months financing at 0%, the price is $5,000+. So yeah, not really 0%.

t5_2qstm,To pay off debt before or after buying a house,"To pay off debt before or after buying a house Hello! Me and my husband are looking to buy a house by June of this year. I’ll be getting about $150k from my mom selling my grandmas house as part of an inheritance to put towards a house. I currently have $16k in debt (mostly medical that went onto credit cards a few years ago) and the houses we’re looking at buying are around $160-180k. 

I’ve been having trouble getting my debt down as the interest rates are pretty high and the area we’re living in has a pretty high cost of living. The area we’ll be moving to is much lower. I planned to save $20k out of the inheritance to get rid of my debt as well as help with any moving costs/furniture or appliances we may need. 

Should I pay off the debt before or after we close on the house? Should I do a half payment before buying and pay off the rest later? My credit score is in the 660’s right now and the only thing affecting it negatively is my high usage of credit. I don’t plan on closing the cards once they’re paid off as one is my only regular credit card, and the other is a care credit which I use for our pets in emergencies.

t5_2qstm,June goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out!,"June goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out! Me: 31/F, fully employed, $3,145 net take home each month

I have been slowly working my way out of credit card debt for the past three years. With a little over one year of payments left to go on my $20K debt consolidation loan, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

With that, I have been closely monitoring where my money has been going this year. I am very good about tracking how my money is distributed (bills, rent, loan payments, etc) but have never been good about tracking what I have been spending my money on. In looking at my spending habits in January, February, March, April, and now May I have confirmed what I already knew in my head... I spend a shit ton of money eating out. In January, I spent $400 eating out on just breakfast (coffee) and lunches alone. In February, close to $500. Same goes for March and April. I was way down in May because I made a conscious effort to not eat out so that I could save up for a trip I took. It helped a lot.

I took a look at my calendar and found that I miraculously have ONE lunch appointment on the calendar and no breakfast appointments in June. This means I have an opportunity to save money by eating breakfast at home and packing my lunch every day. 

I know this seems so simple but I haven't always been good about this. My work culture is such that people eat out a lot, I meet with people over coffee or lunches frequently, and so on. Some of that I get reimbursed but a lot of it is just eating out with coworkers. I live in a mid-sized city, so lunches cost anywhere from $10-18/lunch. Not terrible, but like many of you know, that adds up!

I'm excited to challenge myself this month and hopefully save a butt load of money. This money could be better spent either in savings account (that's dismal right now) or paying off loans. 

Thanks for reading. I really feel like I am starting to make a turn in how I manage money and am so looking forward to financial freedom in the very near future. My June goal to not eat breakfast or lunches out will help give me the boost I need and hopefully, become a habit of mine.

**EDIT (6/1, 8:40AM EST):** 
Wow! I wasn't quite expecting that type of response! A couple of things I learned from you.

* Scaling back or cutting the number of meals you eat out can make a big difference financially.  
* It can also make a difference health-wise!  
* It's important to be strategic about when you eat out, especially when it comes to work and colleagues. Even though you aren't going out and buying lunch, don't exclude yourself from group situations if possible.  
* When meal planning, variety is key. Some of you mentioned getting bored with the meals you were making at home and as a result, would slip up and buy food.  
* r/mealprepsunday was mentioned several times as a resource for planning.  
* Really examine why you're in debt to begin with. And once you pay off that debt, consider investing the money you no longer are using to pay down debt. Your future self with thank you!  
* More than anything, it's about having realistic goals and making sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure. 

I very much enjoyed reading all of your responses, tips, and well-wishes! It has given me great motivation for today - Day 1! For breakfast I had Cheerios at home. I packed myself a lunch and headed to work where I am now sipping a free hazelnut coffee. 

I look forward to catching up with you all at the end of the month. For my own purposes, I will be keeping a daily log of what I spend (including non-food related items), what I meal prep and eat, and what noticeable changes I see. I've never had a ""blog"" so to speak, but I might consider starting one so I can share all of this with you later this month. Any suggestions you have for sites would be most helpful!

CHEERS!

Was expecting a more unified response that maybe I was just overlooking in my situation. Nonetheless, thank you for all the thoughtful responses and friendly support!**


32 years old in MCOL area with solid IT job of 7 years. 

Salary: $80K

Net monthly income: $3600

Leftover after rent and bills: $1000

Roth IRA, HSA, employer 401K match all maxed

$15K in savings. Assume my mortgage would be the same as what I’m paying currently to rent. 

Have a leased Lexus and I’m handing back the keys in June when the lease ends (which will free up $600 in extra cash flow per month). I’m also living in an apartment and the lease ends in July. 

Scenario 1) I can go out and buy a $10K Toyota in cash and have $5K as a small emergency fund while I build it back up using the extra cash flow. Sign apt lease for another year while I build up my savings again to put down on a house/duplex later. 

Scenario 2) I can take that $10/15K  and put it down on a duplex now and house hack. Build equity and have a home secured for the future. Eventually buy another home and rent out the 2nd part of the duplex I was formerly living in for cash flow and extra equity. 

———————————————

Thoughts on each scenario:

Scenario 1 - I’ll have a paid off reliable car for years to come and increased cash flow to build the e-fund up faster. But the downside is that I continue to rent. 

Scenario 2 - an FHA loan allows me to put $10K down to secure a home (another $5k in savings for maintenance), build equity and create extra cash flow in the process. Downside is I wouldn’t have much for a down payment on a car so I’ll be paying a higher monthly payment and have a car that is not close to being paid off.

We did it guys! My fiancé and I managed to back out of this terrible loan, 5 days after signing. Here’s the full story of how this loan was unwinded if you’re interested:

The day after signing, we went in and told them we’d like to cancel. We expressed our regrets with signing without giving it enough thought. I even told them how debilitating my anxiety can be, which contributed to me succumbing to the high pressure they give customers. They denied the high pressure and said that there was no reason for me to be anxious. I fought that point a little but but ultimately told them it was a mistake and that we’d be so grateful if they could void the contract. The sales manager seemed disappointed but okay to see if he can make that happen for us. He left to talk to his GM and came back 5 min later, saying that he would cancel but cannot because the loan has “gone through” with the bank. Apparently, there was nothing the dealership could do. Bewildered, we gave the bank a call to see if it actually works that way. After a 2-hour hold, we got to a CSR who told us that nothing would have gone through in less than 24 hours and that it is 100% not up to the bank to keep this loan in place. 

We went back to the sales manager and told him this. There was a lot of back and forth (obviously they were lying to us) and the GM came into the picture. The GM was very contradictory, going from saying “we made it clear to you that there’s nothing in my power that can void this contract” to “legally I don’t have to do anything for you.” He also reminded us that he now owns the car that we traded in. He pointed out how great of a car we signed up for, highest trim, sunroof, etc. When we told him that it’s not about the car but about the loan, he tried to convince us that we were doing the math wrong and aren’t looking at the bigger picture (less interest payments). We expressed that we really don’t want it. He gave us a deal: pay him $5k to get your old car back and cancel this loan, or keep the contract but receive incentives such as $2000 rebate, free oil changes for life, etc. We told him we’d think it over and come back tomorrow. We did not take delivery of the new car.

The next day (Saturday), my fiancé went in alone cause I had work. Taking the advice from fellow redditors, we decided to go into offense mode. I had drafted a letter explaining our experience with them to be mailed to various consumer affairs agencies in our region. He went in with that letter. In the middle of the showroom, my fiancé told the GM that we are willing to take the $5k deal to get our car back (this was a bluff, just wanted to see where it would take us). He asked the GM if we could have this deal written on paper so that we can have it looked over by our lawyer and ensure that we will get our car back from this (we never actually had a lawyer). Taken aback, the GM said that he feels bad taking our money like that and went on to encourage us to keep the new car. By this point, my fiancé was getting pissed and raised his voice. He told the GM that in no way is this car deal good for us and that he’d like him to stop trying to shove it down our throats. He told him that a lower interest rate doesn’t mean shit if we’re getting ripped off $20k. He pulled out the letter, told him that we’ll be contacting these agencies and that we will be going forward with a lawyer. He also mentioned that all conversations since the day before have been recorded. The GM chuckled and told him to do whatever he wants (all this was happening in the showroom with many employees watching in silence). The GM kept saying “let me figure something out for you, don’t stress, man” and my fiancé stormed out. Outside the dealership, in plain view of the people inside, he took multiple photos of the new car and of a misleading ad sign they had for “one year of car insurance on us.” The GM ran out to him and said “I didn’t want to say this in front of them but I do want to cancel this for you. Just give me till Monday cause the banks are closed tomorrow. I gotta make some calls and pull some strings. Trust me, I’ll do what I can. Don’t stress”

Fast foward to Tuesday morning. We went into the dealership expecting the GM to make up another reason to keep us locked in. To our pleasant surprise, we were welcomed by their finance director who took us into her office and offered us two options: keep the car contract but with biweekly payments reduced to $371 CAD biweekly (from $389) with a slightly lower interest rate, or cancel the contract but pay $1200 CAD for the new car restocking fee and servicing that had already been done on our old car. We paid them the $1200 and drove off in our old car, taking that as the price to pay for our bad decision. 

It was important for me to write all this out for anyone in the future who finds themselves in this situation. There is hope and if you stand your ground, you have a chance to get out of a bad car deal. I think it helped that we initially acknowledged our responsibility in this instead of putting all the blame on them. This was a big life lesson for us and I’m kind of glad to have gotten that lesson early in life (we are in our early twenties). My parents saw nothing wrong with this car deal. That was a big eye opener for me. Many older adults just aren’t smart with money and I don’t want to be like that. We will soon be looking into refinancing our current car, pay it down and not even think about getting rid of it before we break even!","[69.0, 5.0, 2000.0, 5.0, 20.0, 371.0, 389.0, 1200.0, 1200.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ftpa8s/update_on_that_69k_cad_car_loan_i_signed_up_for/
t5_2qstm,The three month rule,"The three month rule Years ago, as I was first starting on my journey to financial stability, I had a problem with impulsive buying. Not expensive things, but they would add up. So I came up with a rule for myself: I need to **want it** for more than three months before I would buy it.

This worked well, and I have since changed my behavior so much that I don't even need to follow the rule anymore. I can instantly sense when it's an impulsive buy, and when it's something I really believe would improve my life satisfaction.

So, after reading this sub for a while now, I'm curious if you have some similar rules of thumb for yourself. Not necessarily for impulsive buys, but perhaps for other venues of personal finance management. Something we could all learn from?
If so, please share.

---

EDIT: wow, so many different responses, I can't keep track anymore. thank you for all your feedback. So far I've gotten a lot of good comments.

In a nutshell, these are the best ideas I could find in the feed:

- for every 100 dollars spent do that amount of hours to do the research (100 dollars = 1 hour)

- walk around the store with the item before you buy it, called ""walking the item"" - this was the funniest one

- use wishlists to defer decision to a later time

- spending in terms of days of retirement (would i rather buy $100 item or retire two days early?)

- thinking in terms of hours worked (I need to work for x amount of hours to buy this. is it worth it?)

- a variation on the above one, where you first deduct your living expenses, what remains you calculate into hourly wage that you *really* have at your disposal and only then consider how many hours you need to work for it

- buying only after running x number of miles (works both for impulse buys and getting yourself in shape)

- the old 'if you can't afford two of those, you can't afford one' was very common and very popular ([a variation on this with a 3x approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djq4357/))

- a lot of jokes how you can't do this with food (teasing me about the three month thing)

- and other that said they do that for food as well (obviously not in terms of not eating, but rather in terms of eating certain junk foods they like)

- buy memories, not things

- practicing artificial scarcity. This one is a bit trickier to explain so [I'll let the original comment speak for itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djpaw4u/)

- think about the dollar per use ratio. So if it's something you won't use often, how expensive is it? Is it worth it?

- take a picture of the item you want while shopping. at home look at the pictures and do the research. usually you realize you didn't really want it by then

I hoped I would get more that weren't for impulse buys, like I stated above... Other personal finance life hacks, but I'm sure these rules of thumb can be used by others.

Also, my mailbox is full, sorry I can't respond to all of you. I really tried :)

t5_2qstm,2 years later UPDATE: Need to buy a house within 6 months (Pregnant). Trying to quickly improve credit score.,"2 years later UPDATE: Need to buy a house within 6 months (Pregnant). Trying to quickly improve credit score. [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vtetl/need_to_buy_a_house_within_6_months_pregnant/)

I always love updates, so I figured I would share mine. 

So, after I was torn apart in my original thread, my boyfriend and I sat down and discussed feasibility. We decided to put buying a house on hold for awhile. We didn't wait as long as we had originally determined because we got back our interest rate and it wasn't as bad as some people had predicted. Additionally, my dad pointed out that we could always refinance.  I ran the numbers 15 different ways and looked at our budget from all angles and decided that while it financially may be better to wait, we could afford it if it was our priority. After sorting everything out, we started shopping, and we bought a house in July when I was 5 months pregnant.

**So, here are our current stats:**

House Cost: 275k with 5k in closing costs credit

Original Interest Rate: 4.75%

Refinanced September 2015 Interest Rate: 4.025%

PMI: $150

Down Payment: 25k (Just under 10%)

Current Equity: 16%

Current Credit Scores:

* Me- 780
* Him- 670

Income: 

* Me- 63k plus ~10% bonus (as of December 2015. Prior to that, I had one raise in May 2014 so 45k to 50k)
* Him- ~90k (contingent on work-- he's a welder)

Savings: 15k 

Retirement: I'll be honest-- I'm not sure about this one because his pension complicates things. Mine has 28k and I plan start putting into a Roth IRA this year. His has much much more between his 401k and pension. 

A note on the credit scores-- they pretty much immediately recovered when we started to pay a mortgage. My husband's is low still because when we transferred him to my cell phone family plan right around when we bought the house, there was a residual bill that he was not notified of (it went to our old apartment), and it went to collections. That was a very nasty surprise when we went to refinance, and cost us our 3.75% interest rate that we thought we were going to get. I now am our CFO and manage all the bills, so we shouldn't have anything slipping through the cracks anytime soon. His score should make a full recovery soon enough. 

**Key Takeaways:**

I think if I could do it all again, I would still buy our house. We got a great deal and honestly I haven't seen a house cheaper than 300k in our area since we bought it, outside of ones that needed to be gutted. We are 6 blocks from my parents, have a huge yard, and my walk to the train is 7 minutes. In the span of just over a year, we bought a house, had a baby, and got married. I'm excited to have some of the most expensive things in my life finished, and we are saving a ton of money each month now. 

Personal finance has been a great help to me over the years but I will say that in that scenario, knowing what I know now, I didn't think that the answers were necessarily helpful nor entirely accurate. I'd say people got caught up in their opinions of my stress and relationship rather than the financial aspects. The decision to buy a house was easily feasible with our finances, but not necessarily a perfect financial decision. I'd happily pay the price all over again to end up in this house. 

What would have been more helpful towards making a decision: 

* understanding that PMI increases with lower down payment and credit scores
* info on closing costs (I had NO idea how much they were)
* info on how long it takes for credit scores to recover-- if I knew that I could make improvements in a year, I may have been more likely to wait

Overall, I'm thankful that people pushed me to think the decision through more and to really do an in depth financial analysis. Ironically, that analysis led me to increase our budget, because I realized that we were way below 30% of our gross with our initial budget. We didn't like the first batch of houses we saw, and increasing our budget allowed us to see houses that were exactly what we wanted and that we'd actually be willing to stay in for long term. 

**Current Questions**

* College fund-- it seems like the 529b is the right way to go. Are there any major downsides that I'm missing?
* Grocery bills-- we are averaging 1k per month. We eat organic and buy fancy coffee, but that's it. Anyone have tips for planning meals/shopping successfully without any extreme couponing/going to 5 stores would be appreciated. For instance-- buying meat on sale and vacuum sealing for deep freezing-- is that financially efficient?
* For equivalent cash value, are points better on CCs, or miles? I would make use of either, so I'm just trying to get the best bang for my buck. 
* Also for CCs-- are their any cards that reward more or are better for someone who spends say 30k-50k per year? We put *everything* on CC (and pay it off each month) so I'm just trying to make sure that is optimized. 
* For taxes-- our income last year put us in the bracket where we no longer got the child tax credit. I would have to put 9k into my traditional IRA to be eligible again-- is that worth it? The credit is 4k...


Thanks PF... I read posts pretty much daily and I've learned a lot. Again, I don't think that purchasing my house was a financially smart decision, but it was easily feasible and it made sense for our priorities. We will soon have our PMI gone (paying extra each month) and at that point I'll be satisfied with our mortgage.

t5_2qstm,"After 18 months, my wife and I paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. Time to save for a house!","After 18 months, my wife and I paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. Time to save for a house! I don't really have any particularly interesting methods to share, just the tried and true stuff you've seen on here a million times. I will share none the less, because it never hurts to hear good advice more than once! Also, I think getting everyone's unique perspective on the situation can be interesting. And who doesn't like a feel good story? Right?

So to start with, some background about us. I'm 30, she's 27, and we've been together for over 12 years, married for 3. We started dating in High School! So I guess based on that fun fact alone we're already beating the odds. All of the student loans were hers. When I went to college I was in a bad place in my life, struggling with depression, living with an alcoholic father after an insanely long and bitter divorce of my parents, and generally feeling unmotivated to do anything. So... I didn't, and my grades in college were proof of that. I was put on academic probation after my first semester. My grades didn't improve in my second semester, and I was asked to take a semester off. I just never went back. This was probably the lowest point of my life. 

Luckily for me, the only thing I was ever truly passionate about was computers, and I had taken up programming as a hobby in my spare time which would ultimately become my career. I guess when you're depressed it's easy to hide in the basement playing on the computer all day every day. Shortly after dropping out of college a very lucky series of events occurred. One of my dad's good friends who just happened to be in charge of hiring software developers for a small business gave me an opportunity to come in and interview for a full-time software developer position. So in I went, barely 20 years old, with my only experience being working for a grocery store, fresh from dropping out of college. The interview was a bit awkward to say the least. But... just kidding. No but. They didn't hire me. I was told they hired some hot-shot self-starter with tons of experience instead who was going to hit the ground running and that sounded more appealing than training me as the greenest programmer in the world I suppose. Needless to say I was pretty bummed about this, but (here's the *real* but) if memory serves me, I believe it was no more than about 6 weeks later that I got a call back from the company. They told me that the other guy wasn't working out, he was a bad fit culturally and wound up not being as much of a self-starter as advertised. Point is, he was out, and I was given the opportunity -- literally -- of a lifetime.

I think I received that call on a Friday, and started the next Monday... at $12 per hour. Oh yeah, you read that right. This isn't one of those ""I'm a software engineer making $180k straight out of college"" stories. I grinded this career out to get to where I am now 10 years later, and I'm not exactly the highest paid software engineer even today. I developed a work ethic almost immediately and made a point to always be the nicest guy in the office having heard all the things everybody said about the previous hire. Doing the work was easy since I was naturally interested in programming and had been doing it for fun. That company treated me extremely well. I worked there for 9 years, and only quit about a year ago. When I quit I was making $19/hr, but was making *substantial* profit sharing bonus every year in the range of $20k+. Leaving was one of the hardest decisions of my life because they treated me so well personally and the office culture was so great, but the finances just didn't work out. I had more than earned a fair market value with my years of service, and $19/hr wasn't cutting it, even with the massive profit sharing bonuses. Those bonuses were actually one of the primary motivations for me to leave, because having a bonus sounds nice, but when your bonus comes on a monthly basis and represents ~35% of your take-home pay, it stops feeling like a bonus and starts feeling like a necessity. When the company finally stopped growing and I saw my pay checks dwindle, I knew it was time to go searching for a more fair market value, and I found one. So now I have a stable salary of $72k instead of an incredibly volatile salary of anywhere from $40k-$65k depending on the year, and I feel like I have plenty of room to grow. I should mention I live in Nebraska, so money goes a long way here. $72k is above the curve in general.

My wife's story is basically the polar opposite of mine, so this is going to be short. She has a loving family that are all the nicest most supportive people ever, and she is an absolutely phenomenal student who was always a hard worker with perfect grades. She earned her undergraduate degree in Psychology, and attended graduate school where she earned an Educational Specialist degree, which apparently is slightly more school than a Masters degree, but not as much as a PHD. She just started her career 2 years ago working as a School Psychologist for the local school district here earning about $48k. She worked through school before that doing various jobs like waiting tables and fast food. So until she started her career job, we basically lived on my income.

So the finances as of today are that we have a combined income (gross) of $120k, and we live in the Midwest where it's cheap to live. So it hasn't exactly been difficult to destroy this pile of student loans as quickly as we did.

One big aspect that helped us tremendously is that we've always been a team. I've always earned significantly more than she did, meanwhile all $93k of those student loans were in her name, but this has never for a second been a point of contention for us. We've always been on the same team, and we both are very naturally frugal. 

We of course set a budget, and stuck to it. We cook all our own meals and rarely eat out. We cut the cable 6+ years ago and have been paying only for internet. Both of us have reasonable cars that we paid cash for with no car payments. We both have cheap hobbies, and are in general just allergic to spending money. We joke about how silly it is for us to ""go shopping"" because usually what happens is we'll be bored on a weekend and head to the store knowing that we want to buy something. Then we'll get to the store and scoff at the price tags, and resolve to go home and buy it on Amazon instead. Then we'll sleep on it, and never buy it. 

Oh yeah, and not having kids of course has helped. Probably should have mentioned that earlier.

I've been contributing to a retirement account since I started my career at age 20 and my wife did the same just a few years ago. I'm almost to 6 figures in my retirement!

When she graduated there was immense pressure from friends and family to just rush into buying a house. This was before I got my new job with a more stable salary, but we made the choice to eliminate all the debt first, especially with all the uncertainty with my job.

We've paid Navient apparently ~$5k per month for 18 months. It hurt. But it's done. [Here is my favorite screenshot ever](http://i.imgur.com/WyeQKe4.png)

It feels great to be debt free! Now we're hoping to put that same saving power towards a down payment on a house when our lease is up in ~10 months. And with our new found purchasing power thanks to not having debt, we'll be able to afford any house we could possibly imagine. But of course, we're still going to pick something that's well below our means. Here in Nebraska the most extravagant house I could possibly imagine living in would be in the ~$350k range, so we're shooting for no more than $250k instead.

If you have any other questions, ask away. I'm sure I skipped something.

t5_2qstm,My bank card is repeatedly compromised.  I think I figured out why and I would like advice on how to fix it.,"My bank card is repeatedly compromised.  I think I figured out why and I would like advice on how to fix it. **EDIT 2:**  
Okay thanks everyone for the replies and help.  I'll be turning off notifications for this thread now.  I've downloaded bitwarden and I've changed all my passwords to something unique.  I even set up a new email address for my credit card and 2FA is turned on for all financial stuff.  

  
Obviously I can't go to the bank today but I will on Monday and close my old accounts and start new ones.  Thanks again and I hope everyone has a good weekend.



**EDIT:**

First off, thanks to everyone who replied.  I read just about every reply here and a lot of them were very helpful.  A few things

1. The messages I got from Huntington Fraud did specifically mention it was my card being used and every time it's happened it's been the new card.  I don't know how much of a difference this makes but I've seen some suggest it's my account number rather than my card that was compromised.  It could be, but they're using the card still.  I wasn't just going through my account and noticing weird charges.  They caught them.
2. I don't have an SO or live with anyone.  Furthermore, and I should have mentioned this, but it's always someone way out of my state that uses it and buys weird shit like $50 worth of McDonalds Coffee from Office Depot.  So I'm sure it's no one around me that's getting a hold of my card.
3. I didn't mean to throw shade at the bank teller who said they didn't know how the card was being compromised.  While I understand she wouldn't know how my card specifically was being used, I just thought she might have some information on how to protect myself.  She told me about the card skimmers though and that was certainly insightful.  I had no idea what they were before then and now I know what to look for.  My mom was a bank teller for many MANY years in her life, and believe me, I know they deal with stupid people a lot.  My favorite story she told me was about the guy who came up angry that he was overdrawn and then proceeded to say that was impossible because he ""still had checks left.""  So i guess I was the stupid person this time.
4. To everyone saying ""Why is OP using a debit card??!!?!!?!?!! This makes no sense.  Everyone knows you never use a debit card and only use credit!!111!"" and acting like I'm a moron... well, growing up in the 80s before debit cards were a common thing, I was always told that credit cards were for emergencies only and you should only use it if you need to.  That has stuck with me but I see now that things have changed and using a credit card is the better option.  And it makes a lot of sense too.

And I know I'm going to get a bunch of replies now that say ""I grew up in the 80s and never used a debit card in my entire life!!!?????!"" but at least where I grew up, credit cards were emergencies only because of interest and the fact that it was easy to rack up debt with them.  But as I said, things have changed. Just try to understand that maybe someone was taught something different and that doesn't mean they're stupid.

Most people I know has had their card compromised at least once in their life, that's why I said ""it happens sometimes.""  If it hasn't happened to you... well that's great.  I hope it doesn't happen to you.  I'm 43 now but I was 42 when this happened and i went that long with it only ever happening one other time 10 years ago so... I'd say I had a good run. I've heard of it happening to people who haven't even activated their card yet so... sometimes weird shit happens.

Also with the invention of chip cards, they were supposed to be insanely secure and you just tap and go and no information is sent.  I never swipe my card, I only ever use chip and that was supposed to be the way to go.  You hear that all these things are secure and you can trust this and that and only do it this or that way, and sometimes it's hard to tell what's really secure and what isn't.

5.  To people saying ""Stop using your debit card everywhere!""... I'm being honest when I say that the latest card I got I barely used.  I never entered it anywhere online or on my phone and never swiped it anywhere and changed my pin and everything.  So, I'm really at a loss as to how someone was able to use it.  My best guess is the auto update thing.

6.

A.  I will be closing down my bank accounts and opening new ones.

B.  I will keep my debit card locked unless I need to use it for withdrawals.  I'll use my credit card and pay it off once a week now and keep an eye on it.

C.  I have a password manager now and I'm in the process of changing all my passwords and enable 2FA on everything

D.  I would like to check my computer for malware and would like suggestions on the best one to use.  I want to check my phone too but I've never entered my card information on my phone.

And I think that's about it.  If it happens again, I will change banks.  I just don't want to do that now since I've been with Huntington for so long and they've always caught the fraud charges right away and reversed the charges.  I'm worried that if I go to a new bank it won't be as easy but hopefully it just doesn't happen anymore.

Again, thanks for all the replies.  I appreciate all the help and will do everything I can to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

Original post:

So hi there r/personalfinance  redditors.  I'm not 100% certain if this is the correct subreddit to post to but when I looked up information on what I was going through, this subreddit came up a lot.

First off, I know everyone probably says this but I do consider myself careful with bank cards.  I very rarely if at all use them online.  I usually pay with paypal.  If I do use a bank card, I don't have google auto save it, but again, usually I don't.  I only ever use tap as well.  I don't swipe my card anywhere.

So back in June, my bank card was compromised.  Huntington caught it right away and put a stop on it.  Not a big deal to me, it happens to everyone, although the last time it happened it was like 10 years ago.

I got a new card but then two months later, again, charges on the card that I didn't do.  I stopped the card again and this time when I went into Huntington I asked them how that could be.  It seemed crazy to me that my card could be compromised twice in a short period of time.  The lady there told me it could be a card skimmer at a gas station nearby.  She also says she sees this happens sometimes where someone will have their card hacked several time in a short amount of time and they don't know why.

I got a new card and this time I was careful.  I didn't even activate it for like two weeks because now I was nervous.  When I did activate, I didn't use it much as I used to.  I either paid cash or used my credit card.  When I did use the bank card, again, I would tap, never swipe.  I even examined the gas stations i went to to see if there were skimmers, but found none.

Then last week, once again, charges on the card that weren't mine.  I also got an email about an order someone placed on officedepot using my email address.  (it was a bunch of coffee so I guess this person is tired)

At this point I was just completely at a loss and didn't know what to do.  I thought to myself that i wouldn't even bother getting a new one, BUT I took to the internet anyway to look up why this could happen.

I came across two things

1. Skimmers.  It could be a skimmer somewhere or....
2. Apparently if a website with your card information is breached, it's easy for them to get the new card information when you get it.

Neither of these made sense to me and I couldn't figure out which website could have the card info until now.  I was going through old emails and I found one I missed from Ticketmaster...

yes, I had used them and put my card information in.  I went to the Sonic Symphony this year.  I'm sure that's how they got my name, email and card number and such.

But, the thing is... I don't know how to fix this.  I don't want to just not have a bank card, just in case but I don't want to have to change it every 2 months.... so my plan was to close my bank accounts and open new ones with a new email address.

Will that be enough?  Is there something else I need to do?  Sorry for the long post, I guess I got a little carried away but I wanted to lay all the facts out.  Let me know, thanks.",[50.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fwjxqy/my_bank_card_is_repeatedly_compromised_i_think_i/
t5_2qstm,Paying cash for a car. Dealership wants 100% of the money BEFORE the car even arrives. Is that normal?,"Paying cash for a car. Dealership wants 100% of the money BEFORE the car even arrives. Is that normal? I'm actually helping a friend who hasn't purchased a car in a long time. She is decided on a Corolla Cross Hybrid and has found one at a Toyota dealership in the area that is for MSRP and has the exact options she wants. She will be paying for the vehicle 100% cash, and the salesman knows this now. The salesman sent her the spec sheet on it including VIN number, cost breakdown and the total cost .. everything looks good. The car should arrive at the dealership at the end of November or early December.

The only problem is that they are requesting 100% payment NOW to reserve the car. I spoke with the salesman on the phone and he said his dealership has been doing things this way for the past 3 years and it is normal. When pressed for a reason why, he gave me some lame answer saying that other dealerships ""that will remain nameless"" take a deposit of $500, but then when the car arrives they sell it to the highest bidder. I told him that that sounds like a dealership problem, so if you are honest then just take the deposit and my friend will pay in full when she goes to pick up the vehicle. Anyway, he didn't agree and said doing it 100% in full now protects both the dealership and the customer.

Any thoughts? Should my friend walk from this deal?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the comments everyone. I've passed on the overall sentiment contained here in the chat and I'm pretty sure my friend is going to pass and wait for a car from a different dealership. She's not in a hurry so she has time on her side.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Well this story has a happy ending. I earlier in a comment stated that I called the Toyota dealership where I recently bought a car from a few months back asking their advice on this situation. My original salesman told me the same thing ... do NOT pay the money and walk. He then told me he would check again their inventory because they just got an allocation. Even though my friend had already talked to this dealership recently, my old salesman called me back later this morning and said they have the EXACT same car (same color, model, packages), but get this, a 2024 instead of the 23', and the price was the exact same to the dollar ($30,034 including delivery, but not tax). My friend just put down a $500 deposit. Car will take an extra month to arrive (late December) but she's in no hurry. Thanks again for all the feedback!

&#x200B;

Edit 3: I just texted briefly with my friend. She said the dealership called her this afternoon asking if she was ready to go through with the deal. When she told him she already put a deposit down on another vehicle that didn't require paying 100% in advance he asked her if she wanted to pay partial cash now and finance the rest (I assume once the car arrived??). She said .... uuummm .. NO.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: I just called the dealership myself and spoke to the salesman that I spoke to this morning (this morning I was on a three-way-call with my friend and the salesman). He was actually very nice and still stuck with their policy of needing 100% upfront to reserve the car. Regarding paying part in cash and part with financing, he said that would still require that she pay 100% now ... just a percentage cash and a percentage financing. (Not sure how the financing department would feel about giving a loan for a car that hasn't arrived but he assured me they do it all the time). He agreed that a lot of people don't feel comfortable buying a car this way. It actually sucks for him too as the salesman because he has to stick to this dealership policy which makes his job harder.

t5_2qstm,"I received a bill from my old dentist for services from 2014. I found proof I paid, now they won't answer the phone.","I received a bill from my old dentist for services from 2014. I found proof I paid, now they won't answer the phone. In 2014 for a period of 4 months I did a teeth whiting treatment. It was expensive, around $750, but I was getting married in 2015 and it was worth it to me. I paid each of the 3 visits in full before leaving the dentist.

Years earlier at a minute clinic, I had an issue because the office told me the services were covered by my insurance, which was a mistake. I got a bill 6 months later for the treatment which I barely remembered having. Ever since then I have never left a doctor's appointment, dentist, or anything else without making a full payment for whatever services were performed.

So the treatment concluded at the end of 2014 and I leave for another dentist. Fast forward to the middle of 2015 and I received a bill for a past due payment of $239 dollars. I called the office twice and left 2 voicemails. In the second voicemail I said I think the bill is a mistake, if you need any help clearing it up please call me.

Fast forward to yesterday. Some of my old mail goes to my parents home and I picked up yesterday. In the bundle was a bill from a different dentist for $239 with a handwritten note saying ""your immediate attention is required"". 

So I called them this morning and it turns out the dentist changed names and locations. After clarifying that I told them it isn't possible to have a balance, I paid each visit in full before leaving. The woman on the phone said that the whiting wasn't covered by insurance, and I only paid $500 of the $739. I said again, that isn't possible, I paid every visit in full.

She told me that I need to prove to her I made the payments and she would apologize and fix my account. I asked her when my last visit was and she couldn't tell me ""she didn't have that information"". She rushed me off the phone and told me she would call me back when she wasn't so busy.

I save my old bank statements and was able to dig up the ones from 9/14,10/14, and 12/14 which show me making payments of $239, $250, and $239. 

With proof I called them back and they didn't answer. I called back again and left a voicemail. I called back again and it made the noise like a fax machine. Any other office and I wouldn't have a problem but this office has done this before with not answering the phone. I don't want to get a call from collections saying I owe them money in a few months time. My wife and I are looking to buy a home soon so my credit score can't take a hit because of this foolishness. They are only 30 minutes away. Should I drive to them and speak to them in person? What would happen if they send me to collections? Even though I am in the right could it negatively impact my credit?

TL;DR I paid for the dentist in full, 3 separate payments. Dentist doesn't have record of one of the payments and has sent me bills for the services performed in 2014. My bank statements prove I made all the payments. I keep calling them and they won't answer.


**Edit:** thanks for all of your responses! I have off from work tomorrow so I will be going in to the office in person. 


**Edit 2:** Thanks for all the advice and feedback. Also thank you for the PM's telling me I couldn't count. I did make a mistake in my initial post, my payments were $250, $250, and $239, those 3 payments along with an $11 bill credit from a previous over-payment totaled the $750 procedure. 


I drove to the new dentist today and the office was really nice, but it smelled like Burger King. I had no idea why, but it didn't matter to me because I just wanted this done. I brought with me my account statements from September, October, and December of 2014. The woman at the front desk tried to make copies of them and I stopped her. The paperwork had my account number and I wasn't letting her copy that. 

I had them print out a full account summary of all services and payments during my entire run with the dentist. I then requested a print out of the final bill, totaling $0.00 owed. After she bit into her burger, she printed the bill for me confirming that I now owe them nothing and their system has been updated.

So, there are really two victories here. I get to wash my hands of them with proof I owe them nothing, and I found out why a dentist would smell like burgers.

**Renters Insurance is a HUGE bargain, might not even cost anything.**

&nbsp;

Renters insurance covers quite a few things, including:

* Coverage for your personal content, even if it’s not in your home (eg: items in your car. Certain limits apply for traveling and storage). I typically see this coverage at 10k+
* Coverage if you are temporarily displaced,( eg: you need to stay at a hotel while your house is being repaired for smoke damage, money to replace lost clothes, increased food expenses because you’re eating out every day since you don’t have a stove, etc.) I typically see this coverage at 30% the above number
* Coverage for liability (eg: someone falls in your apartment and breaks their leg, sues you for negligence). I typically see this at 300k
* Coverage for your defense costs (eg: lawyer fees, small allowance if you need to miss work to attend court hearings, etc.) This is included.

And how much does this coverage cost (including the numbers I used above)? Usually under $200; I typically see 150, but I have seen it go as low as 90. PLUS, if you bundle your renters and auto, sometimes the discount on auto will cover the renters (eg:$200 savings on auto, renters cost 150, net savings: 50.) Call your auto insurance, ask if they have renters. If it’s too much, say thank you and call the next agency.

&nbsp;

What would a worst case scenario look like? Well, try /r/legaladvice, browse around for a bit. For the lazy, imagine you accidentally start a small house fire while cooking. It damages a few thousand dollars’ worth of your stuff, plus you have to live in a hotel while it’s being repaired, and your landlord is going after you for damages because he has to pay for the repairs. If you don’t have renters insurance, you’ll be paying all of that out of pocket. Oh, but if you DO have renters insurance? You’re paying the deductible (typically 250 or 500), and then letting your claims adjuster deal with everything else. Have to take time off work to go to court to prove you’re not negligent? They have you covered.

&nbsp;

**Higher Deductibles will save you more money, especially over the long run**

&nbsp;

General rule: At LEAST $500 deductible on your auto, preferably $1k. For homeowners insurance, it’s best to go with at LEAST $1k, preferably 2.5k or even 5k. Renters can get away with 250 or 500, honestly.

&nbsp;

Why?

&nbsp;

The difference is usually several hundred a year, and you pay the deductible before the insurance pays anything. 

&nbsp;

I go into this a little more later, but say for example your insurance is 1500 a year with a 1k deductible, and 900 a year with a 2.5k. After 4 years, with a 1k deductible, you’ve paid 6000 to the insurance company, and then you’ll have to pay another 1k in the event of a claim. After 4 years with a 2.5 deductible, you’ve paid 3600  to the insurance company, and put aside 2400 that would have gone to the insurance company, so basically covered your deductible. One more year, you can use the $600 you’ve saved to cover the deductible with $500 additional savings to do whatever you’d like.

&nbsp;

**Insurance should only be used in an emergency/making claims will increase your rates**

&nbsp;

This is the one that gets people the most. You pay 1500 a year for insurance, you’ve been paying the last ten years, so why shouldn’t you make a claim when you’ve already paid then 15k? Because it’s going to raise your rates.

&nbsp;

Why?

&nbsp;

If you don’t make any claims, you’re put in a group, “unlikely to make a claim”. Because you’re in that group, you get more favorable rates. If you make a claim, you automatically switch to a different group, “likely to make a claim.” Because you’re in this group, you’ll get less favorable rates. On auto, it will last for 3 years; on home, five. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t made a claim in your entire LIFE up until this point; as far as the insurance company can see if, you’ve made a claim and will be much more likely to make another.

&nbsp;

For example: Let’s say you have a 1k deductible.  Someone breaks into your car, steals your purse worth 1500. Personal property is covered by your home/renters, so if you make a claim your home will pay out $500 (cost of loss-deductible). They now see you as riskier, so they will increase your rates. Maybe $300 a year for the next 5 years; you’ll pay $1500 over the next five years, plus you’ve already paid the $1000 deductible, so now you’ve paid $2500 for a $1500 purse. In this case, it will cost you less to just buy a new purse out of pocket.

&nbsp;

On the other hand, if you have a kitchen fire that does $30k in damage? Yeah, make a claim on that one.
 
&nbsp;

**Most vehicles don’t need “full coverage”**
 
&nbsp;

Unless A) Your vehicle is financed, then it’s required by your financing company, or B) Your vehicle is less than 10 years old, then your vehicle will pay out more. 
 
&nbsp;

Why?  

&nbsp;

* Full coverage isn’t an industry regulated term. Professionally, it means nothing. It usually includes collision and comprehensive coverage; some companies will also throw in towing, glass, and rental.  If you ask for full coverage, you could be getting anything.
* Your policy will typically only pay out collision if you’re at fault. If the other driver is at fault, their insurance will pay out.  Comprehensive does cover more, so you can get away with having comprehensive (vandalism, theft, tree falls, hit deer) but no collision (you hit object)
* We will only pay out what the vehicle is worth. Not what it costs to get a new vehicle of this type, not what it costs to get a used vehicle of this type. Doesn’t matter if you paid $35k for the vehicle 10 years ago, doesn’t matter if it costs $15k ro replace it today, we’re only going to pay out the Actual Cash Value, and it typically isn’t 15/35k on a 10 year old vehicle (Much more common is less than 5k)
* You actually end up paying the company more than it would pay you in the event of a claim, because “full coverage” costs more than liability only.
 
&nbsp;

For example:

&nbsp;
 
Let’s say you have a buy a vehicle in 2001 for $20k. ACV is 3k. Your insurance is 1000 liability only, 1500 with collision and comprehensive, with a 1k deductible. Over the course of 4 years here’s what your insurance totals will look like:

&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;|Liability only | Full coverage
----|----|----
1|	1000|	1500 (500 extra)
2|	2000|	3000 (1k extra)
3|	3000|	4500 (1.5k extra)
4|	4000|	7000 (2k extra).
 

&nbsp;

Liability is what you have to pay anyways, so unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do to get around that. For the collision and comp, you’ve paid out 2k extra over the years. If you have an accident right now, the ACV is 3k, minus deductible (in this case 1k). So the most they’ll pay out is 2k, which is the amount you’ve paid them, so you break even. Ever year after that that you don’t have an accident, you’re paying them money that you will never get.

&nbsp;


The exact amounts vary, which is why I have the general rules A and B above. If you’re not entirely sure, find out the rough value of what your vehicle is worth. Price liability only coverage (that’s coverage if you hit someone), and liability+ collision and comprehensive coverage (coverage if you hit someone, and also for your own vehicle).  Take the rough value of your vehicle, subtract your deductible, this is X. Then take (the price of your quote with collision and comprehensive) and subtract (the price of your quote with liability only). This is Y. X divided by Y is how long it will take you to “break even” if you were to have an accident (although this is obviously not the goal).

t5_2qstm,For 5 years we have tracked every single transaction in and out of our accounts using YNAB. The results are revealing.,"For 5 years we have tracked every single transaction in and out of our accounts using YNAB. The results are revealing. Hi all, I was reading a post on another sub of someone sharing their expenses for last year when it got me thinking about my own and it hit me: this month marks 5 years that my wife and I have been using YNAB! So I decided to take some time and reflect and figured I would share. By all means let me know if there are things I miss in this data!

For starters, wow what an absolute change 5 years has made and not just financially. YNAB itself brought upon us the concept of budgeting and tracking out finances when up until that point our lives had consisted of a ""buy it, figure out how to pay for it later"" mentality. Thankfully we were never really big spenders so we started from a decent spot. Secondly, looking at this it's relatively easy for me to see life changes along the way. From renting to mortgage, from having non-mortgage debt to having none. Life uh, finds a way. 

Let's start at the top and look at total spending over the past 5 years https://imgur.com/LVlo2DY

Nearly $500k, ouch. Breaking it down further though it looks like 32% of that went to Savings which is our largest top-level category followed by Monthly bills(ouch again). Debt was a pain and everyday expenses really added up as well. Instead of looking at raw totals though I think taking a look at how things have changed over time is better https://imgur.com/geobw9v

Apologies but it looks like YNAB does not include a legend so here is what the colors mean:

* Red - Monthly bills
* Orange - Everyday Expenses
* Green(Beige?) - Savings
* Blue - Debt 

A couple of trends/events I am able to pluck out of this:

* Non-mortgage debt was eliminated mid-2018(yay) meaning up until that point it was much more than a 17% expense that the totals had shown
* Monthly bills were pretty bang on until mid 2016. Correlates with a cross country move. Everyday Expenses took a beating for a couple of months as well 
* Monthly expenses spiked in mid 2017 and haven't really come down. This reflects the transition from renting to owning
* Savings is highly irregular. Spikes I can mostly explain as IRA contributions.. but the more frequent minor irregularties not so much The last couple of years the bulk of the savings comes in the first couple months of a new year when contributions can be made

That provides a pretty good high-level overview, let's take a peak at the 4 different master categories individually. Starting with savings
https://imgur.com/pfTyopB

Sounds about right, looks like IRA contributions have made up about 50% of the category. I'm also assuming this has some 2014 contributions in there as well given the totals. After that the totals seem to get a bit smaller with other things we have saved up for including purchasing a home, going on vacation, gifting and donating and thankfully we really haven't had to use our emergency fund all that much in the last 5 years! Woohoo. What in the world is going on with Services/appliances/Electronics though? I did a little digging and it looks like it mostly breaks down thus:
* $15k landscaping and house projects
* $5.5k ""we bought a house now we need a washer/dryer/lawn mower etc. for it""
* $5k one-time luxury purchases
* $4k electronics (phone's/TV/routers etc.)
* $2k furniture
* $2k misc services (plumbers/chimney sweepers etc.)

I would not have guessed we spent that much on electronics. Holy hell. :\ Moving on to the next category: Monthly bills https://imgur.com/iaHtkvS

Right off the bat: putting a roof over our heads is expensive. To the tune of nearly 82% of the entire category over the last 5 years. Second observation.. these subcategories are all over the place. ""Electricity"" and ""Utilities""? Oh right.. we basically got lazy sometime in 2016 and decided to stop tracking electricity and lump it in with gas/garbage/water in the ""utilities"" category. Looking closer at utilities: 

* Nearly $4.5k is from LP.. which just began in 2017 with the home purchase. We need to switch, that's ridiculous!
* Another $1k in natural gas for the previous 2 years(MUCH CHEAPER)
* Rest mostly electric with water/trash combining for not even $50/month over the period

Nothing else too exciting about this category. Next up.. every day expenses https://imgur.com/leMPHm7

This one I'm kind of proud of. This is where I feel like we have a lot of control over our spending. Right off the bat, our largest expense is groceries consuming nearly a quarter of the entire subcategories cost. Over 5 years though, that comes out to around $400/month. Not too shabby if I do say so myself! The next highest, homegoods is a bit high for my liking as is miscellaneous but they are what they are I suppose. For our budgeting homegoods is basically things like cleaning supplies, paper products, decorations, health and beauty and so on. Misc are things like car registrations, haircuts, credit card fees, amazon prime etc. For the last year we have only budgeted $50 a month for this category, although looking at purchases from a few years ago it looks like we were just throwing random junk in here that belongs better elsewhere. Maybe I'm not so proud of this master category. Oh well, live and learn I suppose! Last observation: pets are cheap, awesome. Sub categories are clothing/work expenses/and laundry from when we used to have to go to a laundromat.

Now the last category, and my least favorite: debt https://imgur.com/bytFahV

As previously mentioned this was tracking non-mortgage debt. That came down to 2 types for us, a car loan and the dreaded student loans. Actually, I think this category is the one to be the most proud of. We paid off $70k in student loan debt in 3 years. Hell ya. I know that there was at least another $30k dent put in the 3 years before that as well. Took longer than we had hoped, but in the end it's good to have that boat anchor off of our necks. Other than that, not really much to see/say for this category. 

Well.. this post got uh.. long and a bit of rambling. I apologize. I more or less did this live. A couple of big takeaways.

* Tracking your spending like this not only has the power to change your behavior and life, it also allows you to reflect on the life changes that occur and how they impact your finances. The spending over time chart is my favorite I think
* Refinement along the way is key. When you begin your budget categories may be too granular for you or not granular enough. Tweak as you go and keep moving forward
* There are always things you can do better and things you rock at. Your assumptions may not always match the facts. The way to tell is to first have the data and secondly to analyze. Short of that you're just guessing. I know I wish I had started sooner to see what the 5 years before this looked like
* Plan long term where able with your budget. This is not reflected in the numbers posted, but initially we used to plan 1-month ahead in our budget. Then we need a new car. Or furniture. Or <insert expensive thing we had not saved for over the last x months>. The result: scrambling to find the money and spiking the funding of a subcategory for that month in order to cover the expense. Now we try to plan ahead all of those purchases, even the ones that are many years out like a new vehicle so we can spread the cost out over time
* 5 years is a loooong time.","[500.0, 15.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.0, 50.0, 400.0, 50.0, 70.0, 30.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f83u0y/for_5_years_we_have_tracked_every_single/
t5_2qstm,"""You're doing it wrong!"" Personal finance pitfalls to avoid (US)","""You're doing it wrong!"" Personal finance pitfalls to avoid (US) You're doing it wrong!  Not you, singular; but you, collectively.  Among you, there are people undermining their personal wealth by doing things that seem like good ideas, but, in hindsight...don't really work out that way.

Here are ten things you might be doing, and why not to do them.  (We've covered some of these in other posts, so this is primarily a handy checklist.)   If you are not doing any of these, take a victory lap!

1.  **Spending more than you make**.  No explanation needed.  Don't do that!  Even if you like buying things, or don't have much income, or hope to get a better job soon.  Make a budget, and stick to it.  Make automatic savings contributions before you even look at your checking account balance.  Establish and maintain an emergency fund.  If you rely on a payday loan to avoid eviction, you're doing it wrong.

2.  **Financing a car that is [too expensive](http://genxfinance.com/your-car-is-making-you-poor-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/)**.   For example, one that costs almost as much as your annual take-home pay.  Even if it's really cool, or one you've always wanted, or you want a warranty.  Please don't do that.  You can't afford it; you'll be underwater and can't pay off the loan even if you sell the car; your insurance will be too expensive.  You can get a reliable used car for under $10,000.   

3.  **Carrying a balance on your interest-bearing credit card**, because you think it [improves your credit history / score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/credit-score-does-carrying-a-balance-help/). It doesn't.  You just pay interest.  You want to use a card to generate positive history, but you also want to pay off an interest-accruing card in full.  Every month.  No exceptions.  And yes, that means you can't use credit to finance your lifestyle (see point 1).  

4.  **Taking out a loan to establish your credit history**.  You do not have to do that, when you can do the same thing with a credit card that you pay no interest on.  Taking out a car loan as your first credit transaction is a very expensive mistake.  A car loan with a double-digit interest rate means you are doing it wrong. 

5. **Not taking the match from your 401k**.  Even if you watched John Oliver's show about 401k fees and you are now a born-again mutual fund expense watcher...please, please take any match your employer gives in your 401k.  Even if the fund choices have 2% fees, it's still free money.  Even if you have expensive credit card debt, which you shouldn't, the match is probably still the right move.  You could be making 50% one-time gain on your money; that will cover a lot of fees.  

6. **[Cashing out retirement funds](http://www.rothira.com/blog/never-cash-out-retirement-accounts-when-switching-jobs)** to pay for things, or when you change jobs. This is almost never a good idea.  Even if you can do it, you shouldn't.  That $20,000 in the 401k from the job you just left looks like it might be a good way to make a down payment on a house.  Don't be tempted.  It will be much more valuable to you as $100,000+ when you retire, than as the $12,000 you'd be left with after paying taxes and penalties on it in the 25% federal and 5% state bracket.  

7.  Buying a house only to avoid **[throwing away money](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-nonsense-of-rent-vs-buy-myths-that-ruined-the-housing-market/)** on rent.   You need to live somewhere.  Renting is almost always cheaper if you aren't sure where you want to live two, three or even five years in the future.  Your transaction costs to purchase and then sell a property are ""thrown away"", as are your payment towards interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs. (Renting it out later isn't as easy or profitable as it sounds, either.)  Even in a hot market, appreciation is not guaranteed, and major repair expenses are not always avoidable.   Buy a house if you can afford to, and you know you want to live somewhere indefinitely, not to save on monthly payments.  [Edit: owning a house is financially better as you own it longer.  Over a short interval, monthly payment calculations alone are not enough to prove ownership is financially better than renting.]

8.  **Co-signing loans you shouldn't**.  While there can be some limited reasons to co-sign a loan, e.g. for your child, never co-sign a loan just because your significant other has no credit, or your parents want a better interest rate.  If they need a co-signer, it's because they are a poor credit risk.  Once you co-sign, you are on the hook for the whole balance, even if you don't have access to what the money went towards.  

9.  **Paying a financial planner to invest your money in a mutual fund with a [5% up-front fee](http://www.fool.com/school/mutualfunds/costs/loads.htm)**.  Despite what you might have been told, this is never necessary, and doesn't help you in any way.  You can buy alternatives with no up-front fees, and lower ongoing expenses.  

10. **Buying [whole life insurance](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/04/is-whole-life-insurance-right-for-you/index.htm)** from someone you knew in college  to ""jump-start your financial future"", even if you have no dependents.  You do not even need life insurance until you have responsibilities after your death.  If and when you do have them, term life insurance is much more cost-effective.  Politely decline the invitation to a free financial planning session from your old fraternity brother.  

I hope you found this helpful, and you didn't see yourself in any of these.  Extra points if you can use these to help your friends and family as well!

t5_2qstm,Looking for advice to help with my son's future. (Long),"Looking for advice to help with my son's future. (Long) First some background.

My son(40m) has Asperger's Syndrome, because of our lack of understand or diagnoses earlier in his life, he was unable to finish school or get the skills and help necessary to have a job or really even function well. At this point in his life, I am told that he will most likely never have a job/family, will be lucky to even have friends. His mother and I have always taken care of him and his needs, but we divorced in 2008 and have since retired. Since his mother and I were both ""blue"" collar workers, we don't have a whole lot of money.

But because of the assistance of some great doctors advice and them helping get us connected with the right people, we were able to get him properly diagnosed and took the suggestion of applying for disability for him. He has been on disability for about 4 years and we have saved nearly every dollar to try and make up for the past. He lives with me and we have enough money to do okay, but I won't live forever and his mother get's less money than I do and has some health issues that would make it very difficult for him to live with her.

Now, he's not incapable of taking care of himself, his major issues is his ability to deal with any kind of social interaction. Even writing an email causes noticeable anxiety in him. But with online stores and ordering and bill paying and such, I think he could live on his own with some reasonable discomfort and anxiety at times.

He gets about $9k a year from disability. We've managed to save about $45k by adding some of our money and saving nearly all of his disability. He has a PA ABLE account to save money in, but we just opened that this year and it will take time to get the money into the account (limits $15k a year). I mention that because, when we die he will qualify for SSI  and that with his disability should be livable with his minor needs and the ABLE account allows him to save money without it counting against SSI. This is the best we can do, life insurance for me(lifetime smoker and 70) or his mother(disabled now, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer survivor) is just too expensive and we need to being saving for our own funeral requirements so as not to burden him or his two sisters. We have no more money to add and I need half the money he gets to cover his expenses.

He's never had a vacation, a girlfriend, has no friends and we have no money or property to leave him.  Ultimately I would love to be able to give him something like a normal life. At least the ability to enjoy what little things he can, without having to live in abject poverty his whole life. I know he will qualify for things like food stamps and public housing, but housing won't help since living in an apartment building(all that's available anywhere even near here) would be torture to him. the sounds and having to deal with all those people just to get in and out. Or shared laundry facilities, kids, and the smells. Even seriously considering buying a house and taking a mortgage this late in life and squeezing our finances even further if it will help his future comfort/sanity. He lives a life I wouldn't even call a life and couldn't have survived myself.

&#x200B;

Goals:

Get him as much money as I can before his mother and I die.

Get him the ability to live as comfortably for his needs as possible.

Get his some measure of disposable income to enjoy what little he can.

Make it sustainable for his lifetime.

&#x200B;

Average U.S death age is 78 right now, my parents lived to be 81 and 93. So baring accident or illness, I think I can make 78 or more as I'm in fairly good health. He would get about another $9k from SSI if he qualifies and gets the full amount. But $18k a year, with his needs and being single is definitely not a lot. I would like to find a way that I can either skip counting on SSI for him in the future and get him to maybe $25k a year with enough increase over time for inflation. Or count on that SSI and find a way to make as much as I can each year on the money before I put it into the ABLE account. I am not well educated and I know of ""higher"" finance, so if anyone has more suggestions, I'm all ears.

&#x200B;

Thanks for all that read through and made it this far. And a further thanks to any and all that comment to help me get even a little closer to the goals I have set.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

   First off, I want to thank all of you for your information and comments. I was expecting maybe a few replies and some sources for me to look into later, but what I didn't expect was all the support and personal experiences. Maybe I am just becoming cynical in my old age. But I really appreciate it, thank you.

  Second, for more information, I live in eastern Pennsylvania. I have already applied for basically everything I could find/think of for him for government services. Unfortunately he doesn't qualify for most as he lives with me and together our income is too high, or because he wasn't diagnosed before the age of 26(I think it is). 

  As for his sisters, I am leaving it up to them for how much they want to help him. He is my kid and the youngest, I don't want them to be burdened by him and resent or mistreat him for anything. And it's been my experience that family will take you more for granted than anyone. They are 10 years and 2 years older than he is. The oldest helped babysit the younger kids and such when growing up and I think even that was a little much for us to put on her. The oldest, right after having her first child, had to have her gallbladder removed and scarring and complications for just having birth left her with health issues for nearly two decades afterward. She would be able to work some, then have to go to John's Hopkins and have drainage tubes put in and such. So she is just now, in the last 10 years of so been able to get her life on track. So while I believe she will help her brother with his life going forward(if she can), she doesn't have much in the way of resources, other than time, to commit to it. And the other sister, I guess from having been raised with a sibling that needed more attention/leeway doesn't have a good relationship with her brother. Neither want to even interact with each other.

  As for my son, he does fairly well at taking care of himself. He has some difficulty with laundry and cooking, but other than that he does just fine. For the cooking, he just doesn't know what to eat. He's not like some on with ASD that will only eat one thing until they burn themselves out, just that he doesn't seem to feel cravings for anything. It seems more important to him that he has a meal when he's hungry and it's not something he specifically doesn't like. And the laundry is mostly just because he gets distracted and forgets that the buzzer went off. So he ends up with wrinkled clothes and instead of taking a few hours, it takes all day. Which if it's just him is fine, I figure if he does it, even if it's slow, at least he does it. As for things like bill paying or looking things up online and ordering them, he is vastly better at it than I am. He helps me find stuff online all the time and to get it at the best price. He can setup appointments for himself too, online is best, but he can call and get a dentist appointment. It's just really anxiety inducing for him.

  My biggest worry for him taking care of himself isn't the day to day stuff, it's the times he would have to call and spend 2 hours on the phone getting a cable bill corrected. I've seen him anxious for a doctors appointment 2 months before the date, or pacing for 20 minutes because I asked him to write out a question online for me. Sometimes even getting up in the middle of it to put his thoughts in order. But taking care of the basics, he is fine with.

  And last, but not least, him working. My son looks completely normal, when he's with me or his family, he mostly acts pretty normal. So people often just treat him that way when in public, taking awhile to realize that he's not looking them in the eye or sometimes even at them. Or keeps moving away from them or doesn't say anything but short answers when directly asked. Because of that, we've had a lot of trouble when he was younger interacting with people when out. He would lose it sometimes, or disappear and we'd find him sitting in the car. After all these years, he doesn't just run away anymore, but if I stay and talk to someone too long, it has it's effects on him. Everything from sweating and fidgeting to physical illness. And while I would like him to get a GED, even if it's ""just encase"". or get a simple job, I am worried on the toll it would take. And even if I could say for certain it would work out for him and he'd be more independent and confidant, it took almost 6 years of trial and error and advice and interactions to get him on disability. Doctors appointments, interviews, records finding and gathering, trips to social security and more independent doctors and reviews and then, finally, a judge to put all his future on. If he loses that and there isn't someone serious and passionate as well as having a LOT of time to put into it. I can't see him getting it again. And I don't want my son to be another mental health victim on the street or getting arrested and put in jail. I've seen it too much and America seems to be getting worse for mental health, rather than better.

  As for all who have spoken so kindly about me, I appreciate the sentiment and well wishes and wish you well in return.","[9.0, 45.0, 15.0, 9.0, 18.0, 25.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i4qm0v/looking_for_advice_to_help_with_my_sons_future/
t5_2qstm,Stay in rental house we pay peanuts for? Or make the leap and buy a house...?,"Stay in rental house we pay peanuts for? Or make the leap and buy a house...? Hi PF!  
  
So me and sister live in a rental house that we pay peanuts for, because the landlords are old family friends and only charge us the amount of taxes on the house. It's a wonderful deal and they are wonderful people for letting us stay here for years.  
  
Sisters BF has moved in with us and we split the rent/ bills 3 ways as of about a year ago.  
  
My BF of two years would love to buy a house, and we recently had the ""big"" talk about our future and marriage/ kids, all that stuff, and we are on pretty much the same page, and I am over the moon about it.  
  
He has 30K saved up for a house DP... (I have nothing saved, due to paying off credit, but I am about to be in a wayyyy better place in about 6 months after the last debt is paid off (throwing all of my $ at it)  
  
We will both have about $2200 a month extra cash after bills, after about May (barring any unforeseen emergencies)  
  
What is the smartest move here?  
  
He could move in with me here, and save more for the DP and maybeeee wait for house market to get better? (lol)  
  
he buys what he can now, and I keep my address here where I am now, and I either contribute to his ""rent"" and we combine later after we have lived together and are sure we are all in? (I am practical (I think), and I know sometimes things don't work out, and I don't want him to feel pressured or screw him over at all, and I know it can get messy with partners living together and finances...)  
  
Get married in a few months and buy what we can afford together... I like this one best, but it's also the scariest lol. I am kind of hesitant to leave this house here because of the amazing deal we are getting... (and the fact it is an awesome house with land in north DFW) (would loooove to buy this one but it's sitting at about 1.5M right now lol)  
  
Of course I would love our lives to be entwined together in the long run, but we have kind of just talked about this, and I certainly don't want to rush into anything, or make him feel rushed in any way.  
  
He currently lives with his parents though, to save up house DP money, and I know he is ready to get out.  
  
So I guess, should we live here together with meager rent for a year or two and save together for a while? Or wait a few months (I think proposal is in the cards within a few months 🥰) and then go all in together and get what we can?  
  
The only reason I am trepidations about both living here is the spacing arrangements. I sort of just have one big room as 'my area', and we both respect each others alone time and privacy. I would need to figure out some way to have an area that he could feel like was his own space. I go to bed early and get up early most days and I certainly don't expect him to cater to whatever I need/want to do so I would want him to feel like he has his own space he can go to.  
  
Anyways, that is a big ramble, but honestly I am so freaking excited for whatever we do. Finally having the big talk about everything has got me all a flutter about the future, but my type A mind goes right to the 'nitty gritty details"" like that....  
  
(The housing market is scaring the shit out of me, I have never looked before, but after a few initial searches, what the actual fuck!!! I know it was bad, but I am using calculators and I am finding buying a house to be a miserable daunting experience that takes all of our extra money...This is crap guys :( )  
  
(Oh and one more note, we actually don't know exactly how long we will be able to live in our current rental house. Our landlords could decide to sell at any moment, and that would totally be their right to do. (Of course they would give us plenty of time to find other arrangements, they really are great people), but I certainly don't expect this situation to last forever. But as of now, there is no sign of them selling, and I am finally in a place where I will actually be able to SAVE money, instead of paying off debt., so it feels wrong somehow to just leave here and pick up a giant mortgage bill...)  
  
Sorry if I just word vomited at y'all PF! I don't know if that all makes sense but maybe I just need someone to tell me, like ""duh girl, you need to do this!...""  
  
(I am also the most indecisive, commitment fearing person ever. This is the first person who has learned this about me, moved slow, and I can't tell you how much that has made a difference. Instead of wanting to run for the hills, I actually want a life with this fella.)",[2200.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17cpbga/stay_in_rental_house_we_pay_peanuts_for_or_make/
t5_2qstm,I did not understand the financial consequences of becoming an expat. Could use your advice.,"I did not understand the financial consequences of becoming an expat. Could use your advice.  Hey PF, I could really use some advice. I’ve already done some research but I’m not finding helpful information. Also, I know that there is an r/expatfinance but it’s a very small community so I figured I’d have better luck here. 

I am a 26yo US citizen that moved to the Netherlands in February for work. I consider myself an expat because I intend to move back to the States, but there is no plan for when that will be. It could be three years or ten or more; I’m kind of winging it. I had spoken to some other US expats about how they invest and manage finances before I made the move, but I’m learning that it’s much more complex than I had understood it to be.

Looking at the PF [Prime Directive chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png), I’m at Step 4. I have an emergency fund and by living frugally I’ve been able to pay off all my debts. Now, I’ve got a steady stream of cash and I want to start investing it. When I moved, my original plan was to max out my 401k, then a personal IRA and then get into Mutual Funds. 

Well. There are the problems with that plan.

**The problems:** 

* **I no longer qualify for IRA contributions**. [Apparently](https://thunfinancial.com/iras-roth-iras-and-the-conversion-decision-for-americans-living-abroad/), expats can only make IRA contributions on income that is above the amount excluded by the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the Foreign Housing Exclusion (FHE). Basically, the limit is $100,000, so if I made $110,000 a year, I could use $10,000 to contribute to an IRA. But I don’t make more than 100k, so an IRA is not an option.
* **I can no longer contribute to the 401k I had in the states**. When I called the bank about it, they said that neither I nor my employer can pay into this account, and unless I want to pay a penalty I also can’t move the funds anywhere. 401ks can only be funded by US earned income, and it can only be rolled over (such as into an IRA) if I switch employers. I transferred offices within my company to move abroad, so: same employer, but no US earned or taxed income. The money that is there will grow and shrink with the market, but otherwise it’s just going to sit there. 
* **I am not permitted to invest in mutual funds.** For example, from [this](https://www.offshorelivingletter.com/fatca-regulations-non-resident-americans-cant-invest-u-s-mutual-funds/) article: “Fidelity, Schwab, and other brokerage houses announced that they will no longer allow U.S. persons living outside the United States to invest in U.S. mutual funds.”  
 This one frustrates me the most. From all the research I’ve done, mutual funds seem to be the right kind of investment vehicle for me, and I actually feel like I understand them as opposed to ETFs or other choices. Every US expat I spoke to before moving said that they put their money into mutual funds, and even the article linked above says to just **do it anyway** by using a US address on all the paperwork. I’ve seen many resources online that recommend the same. But…wouldn’t that be considered fraud?
* **Realistically, I can’t invest in foreign mutual funds.** Apparently most non-US financial institutions won’t sell mutual funds to a US citizen because of the hassle of doing the reporting and the consequences of getting it wrong. I’ve heard that it’s possible but not worth it. When I set up a bank account in the Netherlands, their direct advice was that if I intend to move back to the States, don’t invest abroad. 
* **I don’t want to rely on my Netherlands retirement pension.** My employer is required by Dutch law to set up a pension for me, but my understanding is that the system here ramps up the contributions over time and really only starts earning me money after I’ve been in the Dutch workforce or a while (like 10-20 years). I can’t say with confidence that I’ll be here that long, and I can’t manage how much is put in while I am here. For that and other reasons, I want to keep the pension as my retirement Plan B instead of Plan A. 

So. Reddit. Please help. I’m at a loss here, I don’t know what options are left to me. I have a brokerage account with Charles Schwab (with a very small amount invested in mutual funds from before moving) and their advice was to invest in ETFs. I’ve read up on ETFs, but to be honest I don’t feel like I understand them well enough yet to put my money there. What I liked about mutual funds is that they seem like a very low-maintenance approach to investing. Buy them, let them sit and grow, sell them 10+ years later when the time comes. That’s my comfort level with investing, at the moment. 

Other options I’ve seen are to create my own “mutual fund” by going out and buying individual stocks or to invest in property. Creating a “mutual fund"" seems way over my head and investment experience level. Also, I’ve considered property, but I’m hesitant given the uncertainty around how long I’m going to live in any one place (my company could always send me to another country in a year or something), and I’d need to save for a while for a down payment anyway. 

**In short, I would really appreciate any answers to these questions:**

* What options are left to me for long term investments?
* What would be the consequences of investing in US mutual funds anyway? I’m not asking you to advise me to do something I shouldn’t, but I want to feel fully informed about this issue. 

Some info on my finances:

After taxes, I bring home €3270 per month (with some variation. +/- €30)

On average, I have €700ish left over each month that I can invest/put to savings. I think it will get closer to €1000/month once I’m done with setting up costs, such as buying furniture.

Savings:

Discover bank - $20k in a high interest savings account for my emergency fund.

Netherlands bank - €3000 in savings so I have euros on hand for emergencies. At the end of each month, I take whatever I didn’t spend from that month’s paycheck and transfer it to dollars in my US accounts.

Debt:

None. I use credit cards to pay for most expenses to get airplane miles, but I pay it off every month. 

I think for someone in their 20s, I’m in a pretty stable financial situation. It’s been a mix of good habits and good luck to get here and I want to make the best of the situation I’m in to prepare for the future and some large costs I know I'm going to have eventually. The idea that I don’t know what to do now has been really stressing me out.

t5_2qstm,Bank is refusing to refund fraud VISA charges of $6300,"Bank is refusing to refund fraud VISA charges of $6300 Hi Everyone,

Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in but looking for advice. I'll preface by saying this is my parent's issue and it sounds like they've done everything to try to get the matter resolved. 

My parents found out roughly 3 weeks ago that their card had been charged at our local Best Buy in the amount of about $6300. They called Bank of America and reported the charge as fraudulent as soon as they noticed the charge the very next day. According to my dad, the person on the phone said there wasn't anything they could do to cancel the charge and that they would just ""let it see if it goes through"" and take it from there. In the meantime the card would get canceled and they would get sent a new card. Fast forward 2 weeks later the charge goes through and now Bank of America is saying it's my parents' responsibility to pay for the outstanding balance. 

My dad still has his card (it wasn't physically stolen) but BoA is saying the card was presented physically at the store and because the card is chipped and a signature was presented they are liable for all charges. 

They've already gone to the police and filed a report, they have also inspected the security security tapes at Best Buy which they said has revealed nothing (according to them the sun was shining into the camera so you couldn't see anything during the time the purchase was made). 

I'm not sure what more advice I can give them so looking to Reddit for any help or other advice I can offer them.

**Update:** Just woke up and wow this blew up way bigger than I thought it would. Thanks everyone who offered up advice. I need to go to work soon but some responses to some questions/comments since I don't think I can respond to every comment here one by one like I was last night.

**Credit Card or Debit Card?**

Credit card.

**Sounds like this was done by someone your parents knew**

I'm not saying it's not true but I believe it's highly unlikely. Mainly because they don't have too many friends but have also communicated to them this possibility.

**Why didn't anyone at BB check id on the purchase?** 

They asked the same thing and Best Buy simply said it's their policy to check ID and nothing more was said on the matter.

**How could it possibly be there was only one camera that suspiciously was blinded by sun?**

I told them that it's impossible that a big box store like BB would only have a single camera pointed at the registers that was conveniently blinded by the sun. They said they would try to pursue the matter further with the police; I told them even just walking around that BB and pointing out all of the security cameras in the store would be enough to make the case that there are cameras elsewhere and that the police need to go back. To clarify, my parents did not go to the BB themselves to get at the security footage; they filed a report with the police and they went and told them the sun in camera story. 

**This story sounds fishy and you're lying/you stole the card**

I won't deny the story sounds fishy but not sure what I have to gain in fabricating this story. I just wanted some advice from anyone who might know what other avenues they can pursue and never expected this thread to blow up the way it did (it only had 6 posts when I went to bed last night and honestly I thought that'd be the end of the feedback). As far as accusations that I stole the card, I live 400 miles away and haven't lived at home since high school.

I'll try to continue updating as this unfolds.

**Update 2**: Tried to reply to some of the comments but heading to work now. Will be back tonight to look through all of the advice here and provide updates.

**Update 3**: Just got home from work earlier and off the phone with my mom. Thank you so much for responses everyone! I actually forwarded my mom this thread earlier so she could comb through some of the advice in the comments while I was at work and she responded a bit below to one of the comments. She's going to keep leaning on the police to get at those security tapes from and inspect them from all angles and has filed a complaint online with the Consumer Bureau and has drafted a physical letter that she'll be sending to BoA. She's also contacted our local news outlet to see if they can help get things moving along and investigated properly. Will see what the outcome is and post updates in the near future. 

**Update 4**: Just saw I got a PM from someone who claims to work for BoA, going to get in touch with them a bit and see where that takes us.

I give a detailed report of my expenses & background! Somebody, please help me get out of this mess :( Hello first off, I want to say thank you guys for helping people like me who are struggling. I really appreciate it! I am really having trouble trying get this debt paid off. I am looking for someone who can help me come up with a solid plan to get all this debt paid down.

# Background:

I am going to be very honest with you guys about my situation, my background, and my finances. I haven't made the best choices with my money and credit but I have gotten alot better. When I started building credit I was in a really bad place in my life. I was living in bad household conditions and was using drugs regularly to numb myself from what I had to deal with. I am clean now! I grew up with a family of 10 and my mother passed away when I was very young and my sister passed away a few years ago. My dad had to raise 10 of us as a single dad with bad credit & not the best income. We really struggled growing up. When I was 18 years old I hadn't been to the dentist since I was like 10 years old. My teeth were really bad and the only way I could afford the dental bills was with credit so I racked up ALOT of debt getting my health figured out. My first two cars went to shit in a matter of weeks. I lost alot of money on that. I also made some bad investments. I had a gambling & drug problem for awhile but I am clean now and don't gamble nor do I have any desire to. Another bad habit is impulse buying. I sometimes buy unnecessary crap off Amazon and regret it later. I really want to get out of this miss. I will commit to a solid plan.

I am going to do my very best to give you as much info I can so you can see the full financial picture. I am 26 years old and living with my two brothers at the moment and splitting the bills three ways. We share an apartment and plan on buying a house soon.

I have a total of of 14 credit cards which I know is very excessive but I kept applying for new ones to get the 0% Promos so I could keep moving my debt around. My total credit limit is over $100k. I don't use most of the credit cards except maybe 2 and the others I am trying to paying down or they are at $0 balance.

# Current Employment Situation & Goals

I only work one job 40 hours a week. Sometimes I get overtime but not so much anymore. I have been looking into real estate investing for a few years as a way to make passive income and have multiple sources of income but I feel I need to get my debt paid off first. I also am considering applying for a management position at my work which pays over 100k a year. Only thing stopping me is I didn't finish high school due to family issues and not sure if they would ask for my diploma if I did apply. I told them I did graduate when I applied 5 years ago. I have been with this company for almost 6 years. Should I risk applying for management position? They want me to apply and I am more then qualified to do the job as I have a ton of experience there and am in a leadership role currently. Should I try to get my hs diploma online through pennfoster or just get my GED? Please advice me as I don't know what to do.

t5_2qstm,My income feels like it should go further than it does,"My income feels like it should go further than it does **Edit**
Thank you so much everyone for the honest advice, it is appreciated. I actually spent about 90% of the day really digging into things. I’ve known there was an issue for a while but this really made me think about it in great detail. 

1. As I stated before, the biggest thing that happened this year was car & house repairs and maintenance at about $17,000. This was to keep the car from outright having the wheels fall off and the engine explode, and for the house it included things that HAD to happen (septic repair/pump, plumbing issue) and some things that I in my mind THINK had to happen, but maybe were not as dire. For example I sealed the deck, which I did because I saw some issues arising and I wanted to catch it before it became a bigger problem. Before you ask I did this myself, I do 99% of the things on the house myself, including plumbing when it’s not a septic back up that is beyond my capabilities (I’m less savvy about cars). Last month alone I did the deck, fixed a spigot, power washed the house, fixed a couple of holes/divots in the driveway, added/fixed siding on the shed that had fallen off, and fixed some concrete holes that were developing on the outside of the house foundation. None of these were more than about $100 per project but they very much added up. Did I HAVE to do them? No. If I didn’t do them now would they cost me more money and headache later? Probably. Not really sure what the right answer is to this other than possibly burn the house down for the insurance money (only somewhat kidding).

2. Because of some of the big expenses that I was paying for month after month, I stopped earlier this year buying things in bulk from Costco, because I didn’t have the cash needed at the time to do so. Instead I’ve been buying things like pet food/litter (1 dog, 2 cats), the aforementioned and much ridiculed laundry detergent and toilet paper, and dry goods like coffee a little at a time from either Walmart or Food Lion. It doesn’t seem like a lot at the time, $40 here and there for things, but it really did add up, as many of you suggested. Overall, between 2022 and 2023 my expenses for things like this almost doubled per month, which is really telling because in 2022 the leech boyfriend and his two children lived here too, so obviously the bulk buying I was doing before really made a difference. 

3. My grocery budget for fresh foods and things of that nature is also about double what it was in 2022, for just one person versus two adults and two part-time kids. I am being 100% honest with you when I tell you I do not eat a lot or fancy, and I eat out usually around two weekends a month with friends for about $50/time. I think two things are happening here: 1) same as #2, I no longer buy in bulk but instead here and there, and I think it adds up more and 2) I really do think grocery costs are more. There’s actually multiple items I no longer buy because they are too expensive. I’m a pescatarian and used to always have some kind of fish or shrimp around for a meal twice a week or so and I don’t do that anymore, I only eat that when I’m traveling for work. I also no longer buy or have alcohol at home because I don’t want to spend the money on it. I think I need to revisit buying in bulk and being more thoughtful with food purchases beyond just trying to keep each shopping trip as cheap as I can. 

4. I mentioned this before but I spent about $4,000 on gifts and shipping said gifts to family/friends ($1k more than I initially noted yesterday, as I hadn’t factored in Christmas gifts to that yet, which I now did). I was completely shut off from everyone for years due to terrible boyfriend and I think I went a bit nuts with this one. I think next year everyone is going to get cards from me, easy change here. 

5. Discovered that my Bank of America banking has a whole budgetary feature that you can tag/track/make pie charts etc of expenses, which is what helped me understand some of the above. Very useful, but I’ll also look into YNAB - thank you to all who suggested this. 

6. Finally, to address some of the questions about my regular monthly expenses:
- StarLink is it for internet. No choices on plans or speeds or whatever, you either have it for $120/month or you don’t. I’ve tried six different internet options and they were all maxing out at speeds of 5mbps and I couldn’t work with it (and they were all more expensive anyways). Starlink is 100Mbps. I’ll subsist solely on lentils before I get rid of Starlink, it’s a godsend. 
- I’m going to shop around for other wireless carriers. Own both mine and my mom’s phone so I think this should be a good idea. 
- I got multiple quotes for car insurance and only one was slightly lower. Some were higher. It’s been this way since I got divorced, before I was married I paid $34/month insurance on the same car and it was significantly newer. I honestly do not know what’s up with that. Note I have been quoting with “the big companies” (Geico is what I have, quoted with Nationwide, Progressive, Farmers). I am hesitant to quote with the kind of “sketchy” outfits but am honestly considering it now. 
- I went ahead and bumped up my 401k contributions to 10% for now, see how that works out. I am aware I am sorely behind for retirement, I have always assumed I’ll just have to work until I’m dead, or by some amazing stroke of luck I’ll manage to keep the house from collapsing and I’ll sell it for a bundle and move in my retirement to a tropical island where a cabana boy in white shorts will bring me pina coladas all day. Who knows. 
- I am aware a roommate could solve a lot of my problems. It took me 2 years to get worthless leech boyfriend out of my house so I am very, very hesitant to let anyone back in, even as a roommate. I am considering it but I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not sure I am going to be able to go that route. 

I’m sure I missed plenty of questions and comments and I apologize for those that I didn’t address. I appreciate everyone’s feedback very much. Not completely sure what to do about the grocery budget, the house and car still to be honest, but I’m going to start 2024 for sure doing the following:
- Giving people hugs for gifts 
- Watching where every penny goes and tracking in an app of some kind 
- Saving up to buy in bulk 
- Changing my wireless carrier (if I can find a good option) 
- Figuring out what to do about my car insurance 

Probably missed something there but it’s a start. Thank you everyone!!

Original post 




I just want some honest feedback from everyone. I am finally in the $100k club and make about $105-$107k/year. I have thought for years as I have worked my way up the ladder that things would be financially easier when I get to this number but they are not. I am struggling majorly, to the point that I worry if I will honestly not be able to do this, but I don’t even know what the alternative would be. 

For reference:
I am single
I live in an area that is not the cheapest place in the US but not the worst either - according to Forbes it has the 20th highest cost of living in the country as of 2023
I DO own my own home. My mortgage is $1870/month.
I have no other debts - no car payment, no student loan debt, no credit card payments
I do put in 6% of my income to my 401k.
I got solar for my home, so although I have a $200/month loan cost for that, I have $0 in utilities every month, which I feel like is a good trade-off and why I do it (it saves me about $1600 averaged out over the year versus before I got the solar) 

My take-home, after taxes/401k/insurance is taken out is $2789 per pay period, or an average of $1395/week if averaged out and 26 pay periods accounted for (yes, I know some years there are 27). I usually get about $500/year on my tax return. My bills average out to $1400 per pay period or $700/week (mortgage, car insurance, solar/utilities, internet, cell phone). This is $695/week for “spending money” after regular bills, which sounds fine initially but after gas, food (even cheap food), and things like toilet paper and laundry detergent, I’m often looking at $20 leftover at the end of the month. One unexpected or large expense like a house or vehicle repair can take me months to pay off. 

I don’t shop for stuff. I own two pairs of jeans and keep patching them. I eat ramen a LOT. I have an older car that is barely hanging on and I am 100% confident I cannot afford to replace it, but live in constant fear of it having expensive repairs that I won’t be able to afford. The air conditioner in the car died a year ago and I can’t afford to replace it so, in the summer, I’m just hot. I often don’t do things with friends because I can’t afford to do them (go to dinner, etc). I used to be able to save money (I saved for my down payment 10 years ago or so) and now that never happens.

I see houses listed for $2500/rent or mortgage per month or see people buying $800k houses. People go on vacations and, unbelievably, have children. I don’t get it. How do people do this? Is everyone else making $400k and I’m getting screwed? Does everyone else just rack up thousands of dollars in debt and not care? I really, honestly want to know. I feel like life should be easier by now but it most assuredly is not. I feel like I should be able to go on a decent vacation or trip once a year and that is a completely laughable thing to even think about. Even if I sold my home and rented or bought elsewhere I highly doubt I’d find a lower monthly rent/mortgage cost than I have.

Here are all the red flags I experienced today with Surace-Smith, an agency for American Income Life:","I'm unemployed right now and got called by a recruiter for an interview. It sounded sketch but I figured it can't hurt to check it out just in case. Here are all the red flags I experienced today with Surace-Smith, an agency for American Income Life: Remember folks, unless you're some sort of high flyer, if the hiring process is more like a sales pitch to you than a trial to prove your value to the organization, it's probably not something you want to do.

Red flag 1: Yesterday I got an email and then a phone call about a job opportunity. Either I had clicked on an ""apply now"" thing on Indeed.com for a vague posting or they found my resume, but the short description about the job on the phone was that I'd be assisting members of labor unions, credit unions, and professional associations learn about their benefits. The ""interview"" was to be today. I figured this is probably nothing I'm interested in, but on the face of it so far, it seems like it could be legit.

Red flag 2: Form letter confirmation email sent immediately after phone call. It states ""Attire: Business Professional, Business Suit.""

Red flag 3: Arrive to location, find two people waiting outside the entrance to the suite inside the building for the same interview time.

Red flag 4: Wrong entrance (other entrance I had seen had different company name on it). We are escorted to another entrance where several others are in line to check in. A lady in pleather pants and gaudy heels is escorting folks to the back as they sign in.

Red flag 5 (I should really have left by now, right?): I am given a ""personality profile"" multiple choice question sheet to complete. I am also asked if I have something to write with, as though it is a deep and urgent concern.

Red flag 6: Upon completing check-in, I am ushered into a presentation room with maybe 40 total people in the audience. These, I realize, are my fellow ""applicants,"" but I really feel ""rube"" is a better description.

Red flag 7: Observing the other applicants, it's clear they are a broad mix of ages and backgrounds. Some are are clearly folks that can at least present themselves professionally, but others are clearly not able to do so, either because they lack the means or social mores. From their chit-chat with one another, it doesn't seem like many of them are the kind of people I have a lot in common with other than the need for employment.

Red flag 8:The presenters enter, four men and one woman. Man 1 has spiked, gelled hair buzzed on the sides, but it isn't artfully done. He is wearing a loudly patterned suit. Man 2 looks much better dressed and groomed, but has two rings on his right hand, including a pinkie ring with some large emblem on it. Man 3 is reasonably dressed, but Man 4 is wearing a shiny, patterned suit; a pique shirt that is monogrammed; ostentatious cuff links; and a shiny, chain bracelet. His hair is also spiked with gel and buzzed on the sides, though it's better done and fits his build better than with Man 1. Man 1 looked like someone who just didn't know any better, but on Man 4 it was straight up ""bruh."" Upon standing it becomes obvious that Man 4's suit is tailored to his body but still bunches at the shoulder oddly, indicating that he probably ordered it from a made-to-measure website rather than a bespoke clothier in person. Man 4 is also not wearing a tie. Upon removing his jacket while speaking, it is clear that Man 4's shirt is actually too small for his bulging biceps.

Red flag 9: I never get a chance to assess how the woman was dressed, because she never presented. If she did interact with the audience, it would have been after Man 4 finished speaking, but I left when it was clear he was winding down and was asking each person in the audience what they liked best about he presentation. So it looks like the entire leadership team of the org are somewhat douchey-looking guys.

Red flag 10: We are all asked (again) if we all have something to write with.

Red flag 11: Multiple company names are thrown around. I was recruited by the Hartwig Agency, but the job is for Surace-Smith, an agent of American Income Life Insurance Company, which is also owned by Torchmark Corporation (edit: all of this is legit, but it was not clear from the beginning who the employer actually was).

Red flag 12: The company's business model is to sell expensive insurance benefits to members of labor unions, credit unions, and professional associations. In their sample material the full annual premium of the benefits package they market is $1,600, but they pitch is as only costing $30 a week. There is lots of ""think about your family / children / these benefits can be passed on to them when you're gone"" talk, but it's stuff like funeral insurance, supplementary health insurance, and mortgage pay-off insurance. In other words, stuff that is expensive and should be taken care of with a simple term-life policy that's way, way cheaper for the consumer. In short: this business model is somewhat unethical.

Red flag 13: During the presentation the company's success is hyped up. A lot. Lots of talk about their growth and about their revenue and stock price. An impressive chart showing 1996 to now is shown. They talk about how Warren Buffet owns a lot of it. No mention is made about the plummet in value the company's stock price experienced in 2014, only about half of which is accounted for by a stock split, or of how growth has been significantly slower since then.

Red flag 14: A description of who they are looking for is given in the form of the ""Seven Cs."" We are urged to write down the Cs and to contemplate which is most important to us. Later, the five Ps are also brought up in terms of how to get clients to purchase their product.

Red flag 15: They claim to be rated in the best placed to work by a Cleveland newspaper. A search shows they are not, or at least not in the top 75 of the most current ranking.

Red flag 16: Man 3, the presenter on ""technology,"" extols the virtue of their system in which ""representatives"" (those hired) use laptops to show what is essentially an interactive video as the primary pitch to potential customers rather than have to make the pitch or explain anything themselves. Later is it implied we will need our personal laptops for this.

Red flag 17: Compensation is entirely commissions based, and it is further revealed that it's a pyramid scheme. After the first 3 months, representatives can train other reps and get a match on their commission. As you age into the company, these matches increase in size and become tiered. We're told that as the folks we once trained have trained other folks and they start making sales, we earn a match on that commission too.

Red flag 18: When they talk about the charities they support as a company, I only recognize one (FCA), and they all appear to be faith-based.

Red flag 19: Man 4 removes his jacket during his presentation, revealing a shirt that was too tight. He hands his jacket to the one woman, who hasn't spoken to us at all. She places it lightly on his chair back. Man 4 proceeds to sip on a large can of energy drink during his presentation.

Red flag 20, and perhaps the biggest: Man 4 encourages audience members to pay ~$250 for the various online training courses and license application fees to be legally able to perform this job in the state of Ohio with a credit card. He had strong recommendations for which online training site to use - to the point that I suspect the company owns that site. He makes it clear that ""this isn't for us, this is for the state. We don't pay for this because this is a licence that you keep and will put on your resume.""

Red flag 21: At the conclusion of Man 4's presentation (by which time Men 1-3 have left), he asks each audience member to say their name what they liked best about what we've all just heard. At this point I simply leave, uninterested and feeling dirty all over.

Red flag 22: As I exit the office, the lady at reception is very concerned about getting my name before I leave.

t5_2qstm,Teaching My Children about PF,"Teaching My Children about PF I just wanted to share what I consider a parenting success story.  My wife and I have been giving $20/week to our 11 and 8 year old every Saturday for some time now.  Not tied to chores or grades or anything, nor did we put restrictions on what they could buy.  Our goal is to teach them about managing their money and what it means to spend it.  For a long time, we rarely had to physically hand them paper money because as soon as payday rolled around, they'd want to buy something for one of their digital games.  Sometimes they'd even ask for an advance, which we refused.  Once you spend the money, it's gone.  They'd almost always spend their money on some skin or in-game currency on a game, get bored with that game, and then move onto the next one.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  

Recently, my 11 year old has been saving most of his money to buy a laptop.  The last time we sent him to the grocery store (we live 2 blocks away in a small town), he even bought his brother a treat because his brother had spent all his money for the week.  It has been so satisfying to see him create a financial goal and a plan to reach that goal instead of spending his money just because he has it.   It's cost us hundreds of dollars, but I feel it will save him thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by learning this lesson before he lives on his own.  We are fortunate enough to have the cash to give to the kids, so I understand this isn't something everyone has the luxury of doing.  I wasn't 100% sure how this would turn out, but I am glad we gave it a try.

Edit: Thanks the wonderful responses and advice. A common question has been if I’m worried about teaching them that they don’t have to work for their money, which I understand. We do require the children to do chores, but we don’t believe in tying their allowance to these chores for several reasons. The first being that we didn’t want to introduce another variable to this lesson. This is strictly about teaching financial management.  We also feel that basic chores aren’t something that deserve a financial reward, but rather a responsibility that comes with being a family.  We also feel strongly about volunteering in our small town, where many activities and events require community involvement in order to happen. I want the boys to learn that you can work without reward. Finally, we live in a small town in North Dakota.  There chores aren’t just basic tasks line sweeping or mowing. One of the things they help me with is shoveling snow when it’s -5. They also help my dad on the farm.  I’m definitely not worried about the boys struggling to learn the value of hard work even though we’re giving them money every week. They’ll get summer jobs just like I did when they’re old enough, and we’ll contribute to an IRA for them so they can learn that saving early pays off later. 

I really appreciate all the feedback. Definitely some great ideas to incorporate. Thank you so much!",[20.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l02m3d/teaching_my_children_about_pf/
t5_2qstm,How gaining control of my finances changed my whole life,"How gaining control of my finances changed my whole life Hi r/personalfinance. I posted something similar to this a while back and accidentally deleted it before it got much traction. I really wanted to share my story with you guys because my life has changed so much in less than five years. I never imagined that I could be financially stable and enjoy the freedom that comes with it. I had such a mental disconnect when it came to budgeting and spending. If I can get my head out of my ass, anyone can. (I'm in the US for reference)

Four years ago, I was a 27 year old woman with a decent career. I had graduated college a couple of years early at 19 and immediately found a job in my field. I'd been working for 8 years, steadily receiving an annual pay increase every year since I started. 

When my computer broke and I needed a new one, I headed to the store with stars in my eyes. At the time, the laptop that I wanted cost around $900. I had nowhere near that amount in my savings account, but surely I'd be able to finance it. I remember very clearly standing in front of a clean-cut kid ten years my junior, against a background of sleek, glowing screens as he told me that my application for financing had been denied and he was sorry, but there was nothing else that could be done. I had to face reality. I was broke. 

Even making $50,000 a year and with no student debt, I had somehow gotten myself in financial dire straits. That year, I moved in with roommates to try to save money and even when I cut my rent in half, my situation did not improve what-so-ever. I had several very high interest (25%) credit cards totaling about $10k and I owed around $3k on my car which I was paying 14% interest on. I was living paycheck to paycheck, I had no money in the bank and my credit was abysmal. 

I began to think that some people just aren’t ""good with money” and that was it for me. Well really, to be honest, I just tried not to think about it at all. If I had money in the bank, I spent it. Instead of working to fix that situation, I worked harder at making money. I got a second job and put in more hours. I was working myself to the bone and I was burning out before turning 30. 

It was around that time that I met my future husband, J. He could see how tired I was with my job and encouraged me to quit and pursue something that I really wanted. I explained that, in my financial situation, there was no POSSIBLE way that I could afford to make any less money. He started to inquire about my finances and, of course, was surprised to see what a mess I was in. However, being someone who was financially savvy, he assured me that my debt was not insurmountable and vowed to start me on a path to financial stability. 

Now, a couple of years later, I work in a different field doing something that I really love. I make a little less money, but I work a lot less and I am happy to say that the stresses of my old life are a distant memory. Last year, I actually took a hiatus from work to travel abroad. Even on a reduced income, I have five figures in my bank account, a new car and a credit score well above 700. Getting control of my finances changed my life significantly because it allowed me the freedom to live how I want to without the constant pressure of working to pay my bills. 

I am certainly not rich, nor am I a financial guru, but I would like to share a couple of things that I have learned throughout the course of this journey. 

First, if you want to change, you can’t ignore your situation. I was the queen of ignoring. If I thought my bank account balance was getting low, I wouldn’t look at it. If I missed a credit card payment, I didn’t want to see the late fee. I would forget about it. I didn’t look at my credit report because I didn’t want to see all of that red. And in the beginning, when J was trying to set me straight, it was hard. There were a lot of fights because I refused to look the issue in the face. I’d do literally anything else before I would sit down and call my credit card company. Admitting that I had been stupid with my money and committing to actively change was very difficult for me, but obviously extremely necessary. 

Second, consolidate and stay organized. One reason things got so bad in the first place was that, in my early twenties, I couldn’t keep up with my credit cards. I couldn’t remember which ones I had paid or when the promotional rates expired and I had no method for keeping track of bills. Once I missed a payment and the interest shot up to 25%, I felt helpless and didn’t want to look at the statements anymore. The very first thing that J and I did was consolidate my debt so that it was easier to manage. We went to a local credit union and took out a consolidation loan using my car as collateral.  Credit Unions are a good place to start because they are small and locally owned. You can sit down face to face with someone and talk to them about your situation and I found that they were willing to help. They gave me a loan that paid off all of my credit card debt, so now I only had to pay them each month instead of making payments on four different cards. The interest rate was high, but for the first time, all of my debt was in one place. I set my payment to auto-pay and put it on the back burner. 

Third, pay attention to those offers in the mail. After I had consolidated my credit card debt and had been making regular payments for about 6-8 months, my credit score started to improve and I began receiving credit card offers in the mail. Eventually, I was getting offers for a 0% balance transfer. I picked a card with no annual fee, a low transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. (BTW, I couldn't pay off my credit union loan with a credit card. I needed a card that would give me cash that I could use to pay the credit union. This is a thing I didn't even know existed, so examine all of your options) By this time, I had a spreadsheet with all of my bill pay and credit card information so I made sure to make a note of when my promotional rate expired. I transferred all of my high-interest debt to a 0% credit card and then, a year later, just before that rate expired, I moved it to a new card at 0%, so that I had several years to pay of the balance without paying any interest. 

Finally, and for me, this was most important, pay attention to your spending. I used to HATE looking at my bank statement - mostly because I knew I would feel bad or guilty about the low (sometimes negative) balance. Once my situation became more stable and I started saving money, the opposite happened. I felt proud and I wanted to look at my account and see a growing savings. In turn, this made me more frugal and I started to become very aware of how much money I was really throwing away. 

Clothes were my weakness. My closet was overflowing with cheap “retail therapy” items. Now, rather than buy cheap clothes every time I go to the store, I allow myself to buy one luxury clothing item from a high end store a couple of times a year. I've changed a lot of my habits and reduced spending in almost every area that I can. We also live very frugally, in general. We set a budget every month and stick to it religiously. I could go on for another three pages just about budgeting but that will have to be a post for another day. Most of the furniture in our house was purchased second-hand and we rarely go out to eat or make large purchases, since we prefer to spend our money on travel. 

I never thought I'd be a financially stable person. I never imagined that I would enjoy budgeting or checking my bank account balance but once I discovered how much freedom I could have by making small, meaningful changes, I feel like the whole world has opened up to me. I hope I can inspire someone else to do what I dreaded for so long. It is possible to fix things even when you've lived with bad habits for a long time. 



Edit: Wow. Thank you for all of the awesome responses. It seems like so many people have been in this same spot and have good things to share. I wanted to post an update because a lot of people have asked the same questions about specifically what to do to cut spending. Maybe this sounds cheesy, but it's an honest answer. My entire approach to life has changed. Changing my spending habits has been a fight against my own values. Initially, it feels depressing to work hard and still drive a beat up car, wear the same clothes more frequently than you want or stay in six nights a week when your friends are going out. But when you restrict yourself, slowly, the things you find important start to change. You begin to discover that having stability is more fulfilling than having THINGS. When you can learn to find great joy in a free walk through the park,teaching yourself a new skill or how to cook a new dish from scratch, you start to feel that spending money on things is a distraction from many interesting facets of life. So my advice in that regard is this - look at your bank statement and HONESTLY examine every item that is not a bill payment. Last month on my statement, I only had four charges that were not bills and they were each less than ten dollars. Find free ways to spend your time that you find engaging and interesting and take time to truly examine and appreciate what life has to offer beyond consumption.

Update: 2 weeks later, for folks reading this who are in similar situations

1. I contacted my credit cards and humbly told them I'm considering bankruptcy, and all of them agreed to lower my interest rates for six months. By then, my current consolidation loan will be paid off and I'm likely to qualify for a new one.

2. I have used many budget apps in my life - Mint, goodbudget, several others - But none have changed my relationship with money the way YNAB has. It was recommended to me here, and now I'm recommending it to anyone who reads this. The peace of mind is wonderful, especially for a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle. After two weeks of the trial I've decided it's definitely worth a yearly subscription fee, even though I'm not a subscription person and clearly money is tight for me. ;)

3. I contacted free legal aid in my county, and I'm in the process of setting up an appointment to discuss whether or not bankruptcy would be right for me.

4. I contacted several local agencies I'm interested in working with - including my local city government - to sign up for job notification lists that weren't readily visible on their websites, because they use a mix of in-house and third party hiring sites. Who knew!

Good luck, everyone!!!!

Edit #3: I'm so moved by the continued support, even private messages I'm receiving from all of you kind people with great advice and encouragement. I'm in tears with gratitude. It may take me a few days, but I'll get back to all of you. Thank you so, so, so much for humanizing me and helping me see hope.

I make a little over $15 an hour as a Visual Merchandiser at IKEA. My raise is only 3% a year, and there's no promotion I'm interested in. (See edit) I've kept an eye out for a better paying job, man I don't see one.

I have: a debt consolidation loan through BestEgg, 18k in high interest credit card debt over 2 different cards, and only 4k remaining in student debt.

I have tried and failed to qualify for a second debt consolidation loan to stop bleeding out from interest. Last week I successfully applied for a 0% interest balance transfer card. It only accepts $750 in balance transfers, and it's interest free for 15 months. A drop in the bucket and I didn't want another card, but I'm struggling so much with this interest I had to try.

My credit score is 680. I have never been late on a single payment. I've been struggling with this debt for years since leaving a financially/emotionally abusive husband, and I'm exhausted. Because I live paycheck to paycheck, I sometimes feel I have no choice but to use the high interest card for emergencies (plane tickets to see sick relatives, for example). I have *nothing* in savings. Saving feels impossible and has for years. Sometimes I'm late on my rent. I don't own a car or a computer, but bankruptcy still feels like a bad idea.

In September, my debt consolidation loan will be paid off. My current plan is to apply for another debt consolidation loan at that time with the hope that it will lower my interest charges and whittle down my debt more.

I live a simple life and I don't need to feel wealthy. I'm frightened of retirement, and frightened to have no savings.

I am so open to advice. Lordy. 

**Edit:** Thank you so much for all of the good advice! I feel I have a clearer sense of direction now. 

My parents live across the country and both are in poor health - sick is a classy way to say possibly dying, so for my life priorities that does indeed qualify as an emergency. And no, I'm not going to take a management job that would make me miserable every day for the sake of paying off my debts more quickly. I see the burnout rate and I'm not interested. It is already a balancing act to keep my body healthy enough to earn income, let alone adding that level of stress for a few bucks an hour.

But I appreciate the guidance about different approaches to managing debt. You've been very helpful, thank you so much.

**Edit again:** I was trying to avoid this type of share, but - I have several chronic health problems that make taking a second job or adding to my stress more of a risk to my earning potential than it's worth. 

I understand all of you who are reading my story and calling me lazy or spoiled, or unwilling to leave my comfort zone. I already have FMLA coverage for days when my body won't let me get out of bed, and although I can't afford to use them I often have no choice. I don't know how else to say it - my body creates very real limitations for me. Yes, that gives me discouraged emotional reactions about my livelihood.

I've used a friend's computer to look for opportunities to work from home, and I can't find anything that justifies the debt of buying a computer. 

I was raised an only child on a farm, adopted by older parents who didn't have much. I have worked since I was 16 years old. In college, I worked three jobs in addition to attending classes full time. I always had savings before I got married. My clothes are all from thrift stores. I live in a shared space situation that costs me only $450/mo, incredible for Philadelphia. I eat red lentils, roasted vegetables, and rotisserie chicken. People at work comment about how I always bring my lunch and it's always the same, lol

There is not a promotion merrily dangling in front of my face that I am too good for. To clarify, part of why I am not interested is because I am not qualified. My current payband is the same as any management position I could compete for within the company. IKEA has made drastic paycuts.

No, I'm not scrolling through Indeed with Princess Face saying no to jobs that ""aren't good enough"" for me. I literally can't see a career path I feel qualified for where I can make more.  I have been a janitor, a server, a tick farmer, a graveyard shift shelf stocker. I am not too good for things, I never have been.

Someone mentioned working in insurance - I'll look into it. I never see posts for that type of job online, I'm not sure where exactly I should look.

I hear a lot of people saying I should file for bankruptcy. I'll look for a lawyer I can speak with. 

I'm also picking up what you're putting down w/r/t being needlessly discouraged by HR's pie-in-the-sky job qualifications. I'll try to bear this in mind.","[15.0, 750.0, 450.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ak7emz/33_years_old_paying_over_14_of_my_income_just_in/
t5_2qstm,Should I buy a house right now at 23?,"Should I buy a house right now at 23? I applied for the CalFHA dream for all loan which grants the lender 20% of the price of the home for the down payment up to $150k. I am currently 23 and working as a software engineer in San Diego. Trying to gauge my price range of condos/homes I can buy. My budget would be around 600k so that the monthly payment doesn’t exceed 30% of my monthly income. I understand the implications of the loan and that I’ll have to pay it back plus 20% of the houses appreciation value when I sell it.

There are a couple things to consider about my life situation. 

I am currently dating someone long distance and would love to move out there with him if I can get a fully remote job that pays California wages. He lives in the Midwest so my current salary is much better than if I got one out there. 
My plan if I get a house is to live in it a couple of years and perhaps rent out the available rooms (if I get any), then once I fully move out, then I rent out the entire apartment. I have my parents in LA who said they would be willing to tend to it if need be if I rent it out.
I understand HOAs may not allow renting out rooms or the property which is why I’m going to try to find some sort of house.

This is obviously not a fool proof plan. Anything can happen and the worst of the worst could happen. But at my age, I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity to buy a home until much later in the future once I fully settle down.

I’d buying a home right now the best option for me? I haven’t been approved for the loan yet since they haven’t drawn the raffle. But I’m just going through the initial thought process and trying to figure out if I should even follow through on it.",[150.0],https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1cfpzj6/should_i_buy_a_house_right_now_at_23/
t5_2qstm,Growing up poor and reflecting back on it,"Growing up poor and reflecting back on it After going on a major shopping spree today I felt really guilty for splurging on myself. 

I grew up the oldest of 6 kids. Mom and dad were refugees who never made more than $14/hr. We were never hungry but we went without and I didn't realize how poor we were until later on in life. To me, that's just the way it was. I never wanted things, asked for gifts or even dreamt about designer clothing or extravagant stuff bc it just wasn't part of our life. I had never eaten at an Applebee's until senior year in high school.

I remember one year in fourth grade my elementary school had a program called ""Food for Thought"". You would attend an hour of after school session where you'd do extra readings and assignments. For each hour you attended, you'd get a credit that would go towards a large paper bag of food. After a week or two (I can't remember), I went home with a large paper bag of food (right around the holidays) filled with cereals, dry snacks and oatmeal. I was so proud of myself for being able to contribute to my household. I still remember the look on my mom's face as she opened the bag. I could tell she was so happy and it was in that moment that I realized I could provide for my family using my brains. I could come home with a bag of food every week just for an extra hour after school? Sign me up! I went back to school the next day and told all my friends. And you know how that went - they made fun of me and called me a beggar for accepting free food. Mind you, most of them were just as poor as my family. I was made to feel so ashamed I never went back to this after school program. It was also then that I made the decision to never accept handouts no matter how poor or needing I was. 

Flash forward to my high school years. I was so happy when I turned 15 bc it meant I could start working. I would walk to numerous job interviews in my cheap blazer and dress in the summer time for a chance to earn my own money. I never asked my parents to take me because they were always working or too tired from working. At one point in high school I managed to juggle a full load with AP classes and two part time jobs. Luckily it was a small town and both of my bosses knew each other and were very accommodating about my work schedule and did all they could to make it work. My junior year in high school, my mom put up a Christmas tree (we only did it every so years) but we didn't have any presents to put underneath. Us kids were just so excited to have a tree up we didn't even care that there weren't presents. One day, our better off cousins came over and asked where the presents were. My mom must have felt embarrassed so that night she suggested that we wrap up empty boxes to put under the tree. I was even more embarrassed to do this but it made my mom feel better so I went along with it. Come Christmas morning, it was just another day and we woke up and went about our way. Christmas was never a special day- my mom had long stopped accepting gifts from charities once my brothers and I grew up. So as we got older, Christmas slowly faded and that's just the way it was. 

Right after high school, I got married and started working full time. It was the first time in my life that I ever had that much money to myself. It wasn't much, but it was mine. The first thing I did that year was spoil my brothers. Come Christmas time I bought them each a shirt and wrapped them as nicely as I could. I would bring the presents over two weeks before Christmas and my gifts would be the only ones under the tree. They were so excited about having gifts and couldn't wait to open them. Christmas mornings during those years was one of the happiest moments in my life. The joy of watching my kid brothers open their present  (usually a $20 t shirt) made me beam with pride and almost want to cry. We never had a proper Christmas growing up so I made sure that going forward we would. They were younger than me and didn't start working until later so I never got gifts in those years. I never really did get gifts as a child and even to this day it makes me uncomfortable when people spend money on me, even my better off friends. This is something I am still trying to work on and be more comfortable with. 

Anyway...today my 3 out of 5 brothers are doing well financially and I have a good paying job that I got right out of college. We don't worry about not having presents or going without. In fact, sometimes I feel like we all don't respect our money and as soon as it comes in, we splurge and the money is gone. It is something I am conscious of and working to fix. I recently heard the phrase ""poor person mentality"" and that fits me to a tee. I never knew I behaved in that way and I understand that if I ever want to get out of this poor cycle I need to change my mentality on money. I'm not poor anymore but I still feel like I am bc I'm not making good money decisions. 

Reading this subreddit has helped me enormously and I am just passing by to share my story.



UPDATE: (In response to your questions)

My parents are doing better today. They still don't make more than $14/hr each but they also don't have to support 6 young children. They own their own home, cars are paid off and they take the occasional vacations to go visit family. They live within their means and are generous. My mom helped found a community service group and is very active and involved with it. She's a great role model for my siblings and I. She's never had much, but she was willing to give you everything. My dad is retiring in five years and he's found his own hobbies to keep him occupied now that the kids are grown. He's a quiet man and never says much except for the occasional motivational talk with us. My parents did their best with us. 

Like I said above, we were never hungry growing up. They fed us first above all else and we cut back in other areas. I never knew how poor we were until later in life. It was just the way we grew up- that's how life had always been and it was all we ever knew. We each got one pair of shoes every year for back to school and it had to last the ENTIRE year. As a kid, I never knew that other kids got more than one pair of shoes and I never noticed what other kids had. I had a happy childhood. My family was very loving and we had a large extended family. When everyone else around you is in your boat, you don't know any different. How could I, as a child, dream of owning a Chanel purse if I had never seen one? 

The dream wasn't to own fancy cars or expensive purses or go on exotic vacations. The dream was to grow up and get a good job so mom and dad wouldn’t have to worry so much about us.

So, we didn't have as much as other kids but we did have a lot of love, encouragement and hope. 

EDIT UPDATE #2: 
Thanks everyone for all your kind messages and words of support. I'm frankly overwhelmed by the number of people who have commented and shared their story and those who have sent me private messages about their struggles. I am no expert and can offer no profound wisdom in this area but I'm happy to listen to your stories. I wrote this post right before bed just to get it off my chest and I totally forgot about it until the next afternoon. I was sitting at work holding back tears reading your replies.

The wife and I would like to get out of our apartment sooner rather than later, we've currently put away ~$10k or so for just that. However combined, we have ~$5k in credit card debt from when times weren't quite as smooth. We both have very steady incomes now, albeit not high incomes, and were wondering what the best course of action for us is...

Do we pay off the credit cards completely so that we don't have to worry about them at all anymore, at the expense of us moving into a house sooner, and then save for a home or do we continue to pay the monthly credit card bill and work towards the house so that we're actually paying towards something with a mortgage instead of throwing money away on apartment rent?

(military) So I'm finally at the point where I feel responsible enough to open my first credit card (lol). I'm military and will likely be deployed by the end of the year. Credit score 650-670 depending on who you ask.

The issue is that I'd like to finish paying off my loan before I apply for a card so I'm more likely to be accepted, but I won't be able to pay off my loan before I'm deployed. Would it be a bad idea to apply with my current credit score? I don't want a ton of hard inquiries on my record, but I do want a card before I deploy. Was considering applying with Navy Federal (not currently a member). I don't want to apply anywhere with crazy yearly fees like AMEX in case I get out of the military later on.

t5_2qstm,How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k - no windfalls),"How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k - no windfalls) **How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k, SoCal, NO WINDFALLS)**

I wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a low-mid income.

**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**

**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)

**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles

**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)

**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April

**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)

**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal

**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)

**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)

**Avg CC APR:** 22%

**Credit Score:** 630

**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)

**Phone:** $105

**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**

**TV (Saved $130/month)**

I dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.

**Phone (saved $50/month)**

The first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.

**Insurance (saved $50/month)**

While I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.


**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**

**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**

I spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was not necessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.

Also, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

**Excel – Short Term Predictions**

I created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.
This would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.

**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**

I needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.

Balance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200 22.90%

Balance, APR - $3,586 19.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)

**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**

First thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.

**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**

Since my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.

**Create a Budget**

I used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.
This would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.


**Step 3 – ACTION**

**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**

Even though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, and made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.

**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**

As the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to ""catch up"" on payments.

**How to Control Emotional Stability – Allow yourself some joys in life**

VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv

Knowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.
Using YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out to the tune of $300 a month.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to spend this much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. 

If I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.


**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**

**The Beginning**

The first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.

**The Middle**

My next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.

**The End**

By November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.


**Step 5 – The Aftermath**

2015 Chart: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

At the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.

Jan 2015 – 630

Oct 2015 – 705

**Cash Back Rewards**

$450


**FINALE**

In short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.

Throughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.

I hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and ""funner""…than you think.

**EDIT**

Couple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.

Secondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me ""oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks""......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.

Thirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.

**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**

People seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.

**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).

Had I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.

This is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.

I'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.

As it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.

**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.

Again, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.","[10.0, 55.0, 10.0, 55.0, 1000.0, 55000.0, 1480.0, 775.0, 1550.0, 3.15, 3.85, 12400.0, 10000.0, 455.0, 250.0, 205.0, 105.0, 130.0, 150.0, 150.0, 18.0, 40.0, 50.0, 105.0, 54.0, 50.0, 205.0, 60.0, 154.0, 65.0, 65.0, 20.0, 2000.0, 2200.0, 3586.0, 2200.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 175.0, 800.0, 450.0, 1000.0, 20.0, 300.0, 1000.0, 10000.0, 0.0, 105.0, 54.0, 150.0, 18.0, 205.0, 154.0, 12400.0, 10000.0, 22900.0, 0.0, 450.0, 10000.0, 55000.0, 10000.0, 1480.0, 38480.0, 55000.0, 1480.0, 2960.0, 200.0, 500.0, 20.0, 35520.0, 38480.0, 5.0, 3500.0, 193.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4100ky/how_i_paid_off_10k_in_cc_debt_in_one_year_55k_no/

How to shop for a used car.

With a few exceptions – it really doesn’t matter what car you buy. There is no secret list of good or bad used cars, because any car could be a good car FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. So if a model is unreliable – it will have a worse reputation, which will lower the going rate. If you want a more reliable car – you will have to pay more, and even then there is no guarantee that your specific car will be trouble-free. Even behind the most reliable brand dealership there is a service department, and they do stay busy. While most people go for the same brands and models that have good reputation – it might make sense to go for the cars that are not recommend by any guides, because you might get much more value for your money.

More expensive (luxury and performance) brands and models will be more prone to problems, and they will cost more to fix, but they provide a better driving experience, safety and image, so you do get something for your money. If you don’t care for anything other than basic transportation – go for the cheap brands and models.

Buy privately or from a dealer? A franchise dealer or a used car lot? A private seller is a gamble. It could be a nice car that the owner is trying to maximize the value by selling it themselves instead of trading it at the dealer. Or it could be a nightmare car that they are trying to get rid of because it might fall apart at the next light.

So your best bet will be a franchise dealer that specializes in the brand you are buying, preferably Certified Pre-Owned, if it’s an option. CPO programs vary by brand, and they are not a 100% guarantee, but they should give you some assurance together with an extension of warranty. A dealer provides you a better assurance that you are not buying a problematic car. A dealer is required to make sure a car is safe, and a dealer has a reputation to maintain. If a dealer has a car with issues – he can easily dump it through an auction, and it will become someone else’s problem.

Next best thing is a franchise dealer that has an off-brand car, which was most likely traded in. The dealer was probably able to take it in trade for an amount low enough for them to recondition the car and sell it for some profit. Again, the dealer will be unlikely to go through the problem with a bad car that can come back to haunt them with issues.

Then there is the used car lot. Your risk is higher, those lots go out of business all the time, so you have very little recourse, but you will be paying less. Remember those cars that reputable dealers don’t want to deal with and send to an auction? Used car lots buy out these cars, patch them up, and sell them for as much as they can. Your last options is a private seller. A private seller is a gamble. It could be a nice car that the owner is trying to maximize the value by selling it themselves instead of trading it at the dealer. Or it could be a nightmare car that they are trying to get rid of because it might fall apart at the next light.

Pre-purchase inspection: it is a common advice to have any used car pre-inspected by an independent mechanic. Overall it is a good idea, with a few exceptions and footnotes:

If the car is still in warranty or is certified – inspection is an overkill, and the only thing you can get out of it is find out whether the car has been in an accident. If a used car in warranty has any major mechanical issues – it will be fixed under warranty. Don’t be surprised of a dealer refuses to let you inspect a car like that.

Some dealers don’t allow pre-inspections at all. They might not want to take the car off the lot for half a day for you to decide not to buy it or to come back with unreasonable offers. In the meantime – there could be a serious buyer with cash in hand on the lot.

Now, what can an inspection tell you, and how you should take it? The mechanic doing the inspection might have an agenda that is different from yours – he might want to justify his pay by pointing out too many problems. He might hope for you to still buy it and to bring it to him for more work. Then how can you tell what issues are normal and are to be expected in a used car? You can take any car off the road, run it through an inspection, and the mechanic will recommend on average $1,500 in repairs, which you can ignore and still drive the car for a few good years. Bottom line – again, used car is a risk, and you have to decide what is the right balance of risk, and the price you are willing to pay.

Private purchase: unless you have cash in hand – it will be difficult to put a purchase with financing. You CAN get a loan on a privately bought car, but it requires some work. You have to get a general approval, then you will have to get the actual loan for the actual car, and the bank will decide the amount based on the book value of the car, you will have to coordinate this with the seller and the bank, and until the seller gets paid – he can back out of it at any time, and you are back to the start.

Then there is another risk of dealing with a stranger and large amount of money. Don’t expect the seller to accept anything other than cash or a cashiers check. Meet in a public, well lit place, like a bank. Before you make the purchase – refer to your state DMV website for exact instructions on what paperwork is required to transfer the ownership and to register the car. Does it have to be smogged? Do you have to have a clear title? How can you verify that the car is paid off? Do you have to pay sales tax? If you are buying out of state – you will have to check both states to make sure you are in compliance. Sounds scary? It is. This is why dealers charge more, and now we will talk about buying a car from a dealer.

Once you decide on the model and brand – browse online listings. You have no business going to a dealer without having an idea of what you want to buy. Right now my favorite source is Autotrader – they provide a lot of tools that let you narrow your search down, and 99% of dealers list their inventory there.

Make sure that you are looking at cars that are within your budget, and not hope to negotiate a lower price before you even look at the car. If you can’t afford the asking price – you can’t afford it.

Now, the biggest issue that brings the most questions: the price. One thing you are to realize is that the market has changed a lot in the last few years, and if you haven’t bought a car in a while – it will be a different experience, and the good news is that it is easier and much less stressful that it used to be.

Here is how it used to be before the Internet: while there were classified listings in newspapers, most people shopped by visiting dealers, because there were no tools that would let you cross-shop and compare live inventory between different dealers. It was easier to go to a dealer lot, browse available cars, pick one, and hope to negotiate a deal. You could use a guide like Kelley Blue Book to gage whether the price was good or not, but in the end – you had to make a decision to buy there or to move to the next dealer, and if other dealers would not work out – by the time you got back the car could be sold. It takes a lot of time, and used car shoppers don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Here is what is happening now: since you can go online, narrow down available inventory by age, mileage, distance and even options – you see right away what is the going rate, and who offers the lower price. Dealers started to realize that if their asking price is higher than average – phones don’t ring, and cars don’t sell. When before they could hope to get people in and lower the price – now no one even comes in, because trying to negotiate thousands off a price against a professional salesman is just as fun as having your teeth pulled. First they learned to check the market before pricing out a car and to keep adjusting pricing of unsold cars to match the market rate. Next evolution was introduction of software services that do that for dealers. They use it when they take cars in trade or buy them at auctions, when they price cars, when they adjust prices to move aged inventory. The data is out there, all the software does is put it together. Let’s say the dealer has to take a car in trade. He punches the details of the car in the system: year, model, mileage, options. The system pull available matching inventory listed within 200 miles, calculates average and median price, calculates back how much the dealer has to pay for the car so that after reconditioning and assumed profit – they can price it below market average. Also the system will check auction history, and it will show how much similar cars sold at dealer auctions in the last weeks, so the dealer can see how much they car hope to get at an auction or buy similar cars.

What does this means to you as a shopper:

Profit margins are lower, and there is much less room for negotiation. Dealers simply can’t afford pricing cars high, hoping that someone will just bump into it and pay the price.

Dealers adjust pricing all the time, so if a car sat on a lot for a long time – it doesn’t matter much, as long as it is priced competitively. If you found the lowest priced car – others will find it too, and dealers don’t need to discount it any lower.

Once you found one or a few potential cars that match your requirements and price – you are ready to contact the dealer. It would be nice to be able to continue shopping and negotiating from your couch, get the best price, have the dealer tell you everything about the car and hold it until you will make up your mind and find time to go and buy it – but in reality things are a bit more complicated. Dealers have no interest in giving you more information than what they have to in order to get you in the door. Most dealers will post photos, videos, car history reports, but in the end you will have to do your due diligence in person – check out the car and drive it. If the dealer priced the car right – he doesn’t have to commit to a lower price over the phone or email, because it is obvious that you are already interested, and they definitely have no interest in taking the car off the market on the off chance that you will actually show up, agree to the car and buy it.

So when you contact the dealer – your goal is to make sure that the car is actually still there, that it is ready and not still going through service or body work, to confirm options that are important to you, and to make a solid appointment. You want to make sure that you are meeting with a specific sales person, and not just a generic appointment set by a call center agent, that you know who you are meeting, exact time, and that the car will be actually there. Statistically about half of appointments show up, so dealers don’t put a lot of faith in them, and they might not even bother checking that the car and the sales person is ready and available – you want to make sure your appointment is different. Confirm it one day before, and one hour before.

You could ask them about the price – what is the lowest price they will see it for, or whether they will negotiate, but be ready for vague, non-committal answers or for simple refusal to discuss it. Don’t put much faith in promises made remotely, and don’t bother making offers. Your best chance on getting a lower price is in person, once you saw the car and ready to buy it.

When you are there in person – check that you are looking at the actual car you saw on line – same VIN. Make sure it has the advertised options – websites and software make mistakes, it is your responsibility to check it before purchase. Test-drive it. Seriously – drive it before you move forward. It doesn’t matter if your cousin has one like that. It is not enough if you drove one at another dealership – drive the car you are considering buying. Make sure that are no warning lights, everything works, and it drives well.

After you drove it – it is decision time. Are you ready to own it now? There are 3 answers to this question: you are ready to own it now for the asking price (it doesn’t mean you are going to pay it), you are ready to own it for some price, or you are not ready no matter what – either there is something wrong with the car, or you feel that you have to see and try something else before making a buying decision. If you are not ready own it – state so, thank the sales person for their time and leave. It might be harder than it sounds, you might have to have to talk to a manager, but you just have to stay calm, don’t get baited by promises of some incredible deal, and repeat that you are not ready to own this car at any price. They might through numbers at you – don’t put much faith in them, they have no obligation in honoring them.

If you are ready to own it – say so, and be ready to sit down to talk numbers. Hopefully you did your research, you know what the market rate is, how much similar specific cars in the vicinity are priced. You should know what guides like KBB, Edmunds and NADA say a car like that should be priced.

Now, about guides: they are just that – guides. You can use them to your advantage, but don’t get emotionally attached to what they say, because KBB is not going to sell you a car or buy one from you. In the end market rate and your desire to own the car will determine what the price will be. Guides vary from one to another – how would you know which one is right? Some cars will sell well below the guides value because of market conditions, some will sell for much more, because it is a unique car, desirable configuration or low mileage. The only thing a guide will really determine is the amount you can finance, because a bank will not lend you more than a specific percentage of the “book value”.

Show time: you are sitting down against the sale person, and you get into the dreaded negotiation. First – you don’t have to negotiate. If you found the lowest priced car, you think the price is fair, you are ready to buy, you want to get it over with before the car gets sold – you could just buy it. But no one likes to leave money on the table, and if you are up to it – you can make a run for it. Here is how to make it simple and easy:

State that you are ready to buy it now. Be ready to discuss financing, tell them how much down payment you have, fill out the credit application. This shows commitment, and it indicates to the sales person and their manager that they are close to selling something, it gets them involved in the process.

Same something in the lines of: “I am ready to buy this car now, but the price is too high. I am willing to pay this much, and this is why: …”

There are only two valid reasons to why you are offering less: You either have research to show why the car should be sold for less (market rate, cheaper similar car being sold nearby, lower book value), or this is simply what you can afford. Things salespeople don’t care for: cheaper cars sold 500 miles away, cheaper cars sold privately, supposed bad condition of the car you want to buy. Reasons like that mean nothing, they just show you as an inexperienced negotiator, and they annoy the dealer. You don’t want them annoyed, you want them anxious to sell you a car, not to fight you. Don’t make it personal.

How much you should offer? Your offer should be reasonable, but with some margin built in to give up. Going up on your offer shows good faith, and it lets the dealer feel like they are winning.

It is normal for the sales person to “third party” use a real or imaginary decision maker like a manager. Don’t fight it, don’t insist on being in a hurry or talking to the manager. If you are to save a large sum of money – you will have to work for it, and a couple of hours is worth it even if you save only $500 of the sales price.

So you make or offer, and the sales person will either say that he will check with the manager, or that it is too low, in which case you tell them to still check with the manager.

The dealer makes the next move: they might accept your offer, they might make a counter offer, or they might say that it is too low. If they accepted, or make a counter offer that is agreeable to you – you are done. If their offer it too high, or there is no counter offer – you use your negotiation buffer to raise your offer, and state that this is your final offer, and see what happens.

I the dealer is not willing to budge, or they are not moving from their last offer – this is a decision point for you: you can accept the offer if your research shows that it is fair, or you can try your last resort – walking away. Politely explain that this is more that you think you should pay or can afford, tell them to contact you if they change their mind, and leave. They might catch you at the door, out on the parking lot, or call you an hour or a day later. Or they might let you leave. If they let you leave and didn’t contact you – you know your offer was too low. If you do this right, stay calm and appear reasonable – it will likely not come to that.

Process of financing, trade, dealer fees, paperwork – it will be the same as a new car purchase, except for one thing: warranty. Read thoroughly to understand what comes with the car. If it is a CPO – make sure you have proof the car is certified. Most brands will post conditions of their CPO programs on their website. If it is not certified and out of warranty – does the dealer offers any kind of warranty? Is there any kind of return policy? Do you have to pay for it? Is there a return/restocking fee? If they offer you a service contract – extended warranty – read through it. Can it be cancelled? Can it be purchased later? If it is not in writing – it is not real.

Long distance purchases: 99% it is not worth it. Out of state purchase creates issues with paperwork. You shouldn’t not buy a used car sight unseen without driving it. You don’t have any leverage in negotiation, because when you contact the dealer from 500 miles away – it tells the dealer that one of two things is happening: they either have the cheapest car within 1,000 miles, or they have the only car within 1,000 miles that you want. I might go through the motions of working out the paperwork to ship you the car out of state, but if a local customer shows up ready to take delivery – you best believe I will rather sell the car to him.

Things to look out for:

If a dealer refuses to provide a vehicle history reports such as Carfax or Autocheck –either walk away or consider getting your own. Don’t buy a car without it.

If a dealer doesn’t post a price – don’t bother. This means that this will be a grind, and the dealer is stuck in the eighties.

Fees: there should be no fees added to a price of a used car. Destination fee, handling fee, reconditioning fee, CPO fee – all of these are tricks, signs that you should not even be dealing with the dealer, let alone pay them.

You should know the advertised price of the car the day you shop for it, get it off the dealer’s website, print it out. You should not have to negotiate just to get the Internet price.

There should not be any requirements for rebates to qualify for, the Internet price should not be “after X amount down”, or any other conditions to get the advertised price. Any of those are signs telling you to walk away. Dealers that use these tricks will not learn unless enough people will stop giving them their money.

Finally, remember that you are buying a used car to save money, but there is a reason it is cheaper than a new car. In most cases – used cars are sold as is, because even a perfect car can suddenly develop issues. A car might through a warning light just as you leaving the dealership, and you are at the mercy of the good will of the dealer. We have a saying: “If you bought a car “as is”, drove it off the lot, and it broke in two halves – you own both halves”. There is no Lemon Law in regards to used cars. A pre-inspection is not a guarantee.

Think about these things when you are making decisions and browsing for cars – it might make sense to pay more now to avoid paying later, and it might make sense to pay for a peace of mind.","[1500.0, 500.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51x18k/how_to_shop_for_a_used_car_detailed_guide_repost/
t5_2qstm,The Math on Series I Saving Bond (ibond) Returns,"The Math on Series I Saving Bond (ibond) Returns With inflation being very high lately there has been a surge in community interest in Series I savings bonds, or ibonds, whose returns are pegged to the inflation rate. I see a lot of posts of people confused on how ibond returns function or who are misinterpreting the returns...typically overstating them.

Series I bonds have two returns.  A fixed rate of return which remains, as you might expect, fixed through the life of the bond and a variable rate which is based on inflation and is recalculated twice a year, specifically on May 1st and Nov 1st of each year.

The current fixed rate is 0% and the current inflation rate for the period from May 1st 2022 to Oct 31st 2022 is 9.62% annualized.  The next rate will be for the period from Nov 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 but that rate is yet to be determined on the basis of inflation up to that period.

When you purchase an ibond you get the fixed rate at the time of purchase for the life of the bond (which is currently 0%) and the inflation rate for 6 months from your date of purchase set to whatever the inflation rate is at the time, this is referred to as the composite rate.

What that means is that if you bought an ibond today you would get 0% + 9.62% composite rate annualized for the next 6 months from 5/1/2022 to 10/31/2022.  If you bought June 5th it would be from 6/1/2022 to 11/30/2022.  After that the next 6 months would be with whatever the next inflation rate is which will be announced Nov 1st plus 0%.

The rates of return, it should be noted, are annualized.  That means that for 6 months you will earn 9.62% at an annual rate, which would mean 9.62 / 12 = 0.802% per month or 4.81% for 6 months.  It does NOT mean that you will get a 9.62% return in 6 months which is a mistake I have seen get made.

Unlike many other bonds you do get compounding interest with ibonds however it compounds semiannually rather than the continuously you may be used to from stocks.  That means that every 6 months any accumulated interest thusfar will be added to the principal and that total will them be used as the basis for the next 6 months of interest.

There is an added stipulation which is you cannot withdraw the funds for 1 year and if you withdraw the funds between 1 year and 5 years then you will lose the last 3 months of interest.  The way this manifests is that the last 3 months of interest will not show in your balance if you check your account.

So, with all of that said, if you bought a $10k Series I bond sometime between 5/1/2022 and 10/31/2022 this is what your balance would look like month to month.  For now we will ignore the 3 month penalty but Ill bring that back in later at the end.

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Now, we don't know what the rate will be starting in November but with all the Fed is doing chances are its going to be a bit lower (but we don't know).  Lets assume the next period would be 6%.

At month 7 the interest starts to apply 6 month balance of $10k principal and $481 interest.  Its annualized again so its 0.5% per month

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Month 7: $10,533.40

Month 8: $10,585.81

Month 9: $10,638.23

Month 10: $10,690.62

Month 11: $10,743.03

Month 12: $10,795.43

But, due to the 3 month penalty, this is not what your account balance would look like if you checked it every month after your initial purchase.  It would look like this:

Month 1: $10,000

Month 2: $10,000

Month 3: $10,000

Month 4: $10,080.17

Month 5: $10,160.33

Month 6: $10,240.50

Month 7: $10,320.67

Month 8: $10,400.84

Month 9: $10,481

Month 10: $10,533.40

Month 11: $10,585.80

Month 12: $10,638.22

So, after one year you withdraw and you get your principal $10k plus the $638.22 interest.  However interest made off of a bond is taxed as income and as such will be taxed at whatever your marginal tax rate is.  So, for example, if your marginal tax rate is 24% then you will owe $153.17 in taxes which means your total return will be $485.05.  That means the return for a year would be 4.85%.

If you wait 3 more months and don't withdraw until month 15 then you will get the full annualized 9.62% for 6 months and example 6% annualized for 6 months or $10,795.43.  After taxes $604.53 which would be a 4.83% annualized return.  So in that scenario unless the next period is significantly higher inflation it would be better to just pull out at 12 months (depending on your goals).

ibonds are a great option for guaranteed return for any money that you don't need for one year but you will want as cash in the short term. For example say you want to buy a car in 2 years, i bonds would be a great place to stash money in two rounds of $10k purchases.  That said, longterm, ibonds are probably not the best investment. Total stock market longterm tends to return at \~9% for comparison. Regardless of how you view it though its important to understand what the returns will actually look like though so you aren't disappointed by assuming you are going to be seeing 10%+ returns off your ibond purchase.

**EDIT:**  thank you to u/zacce for pointing out some finer detail on the math the cause these values to be slightly off primarily due to rounding differences caused by the $10k bond basically being comprised of 400 individual $25 dollar bonds.  This causes the math to be slightly different resulting in being off by a couple of dollars.  His post on the details of that can be found here[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ug2deh/exact\_ibond\_interest\_calculation\_explanation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ug2deh/exact_ibond_interest_calculation_explanation/)

There is also a website calculator he linked to specifically for figuring out your ibond yields here.

**EDIT2:** Another major thing to consider with Series I bonds.  They are one of the only government bonds that offers compounding interest.  Series I savings bond interet compounds semiannually.  US Treasury bonds and notes do not compound.Why is this important?  Lets say (hypothetically, these rates don't exist) you could get a US Treasury bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 12% a year for 30 years every year or you could get a Series I Bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 8% a year for 30 years every year.  You can put $10,000 into one of them but only one.  Which one would you choose? How much would you end up with after 30 years?

Treasury bond, simple interest..no compounding.  Every year you get 12% of $10,000 so you get $1,200 every year for 30 years plus your principal back.  So you get $46,000.

Series I Savings bond, interest compounds semiannually.  Meaning every 6 months the accrued interest is counted as principal for the next round of interest.  So for the first 6 months you get $400, but for the next you get $416, and the next you get $433.  After 30 years you end up with $105,200.

Pay attention to compounding not just annualized rate of return, it matters.","[10.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10.0, 481.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10533.4, 10585.81, 10638.23, 10690.62, 10743.03, 10795.43, 10000.0, 10000.0, 10000.0, 10080.17, 10160.33, 10240.5, 10320.67, 10400.84, 10481.0, 10533.4, 10585.8, 10638.22, 10.0, 638.22, 153.17, 485.05, 10795.43, 604.53, 10.0, 10.0, 25.0, 10000.0, 10000.0, 1200.0, 46000.0, 400.0, 416.0, 433.0, 105200.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/uw5o7v/the_math_on_series_i_saving_bond_ibond_returns/
t5_2qstm,am i crazy or are the adults in my life pushing me towards potentially life-ruining financial decisions?,"am i crazy or are the adults in my life pushing me towards potentially life-ruining financial decisions? TLDR at the bottom bc this is VERY long but theres just so much to get through. 

The catalyst: my first and only car of 8 years—an unbelievably well traveled 2005 Acura—is taking its final breaths. She just couldn’t make it back through the mountain pass i commute through and is now stuck at my uncle’s house.

to clarify, as ive gotten a few of the same comment now. the acura is NOT. WORTH. SAVING. this is not an exaggeration. i have spent ~3k in the past 9 months alone trying to keep her going until finally the catalytic converters just went bad for the THIRD time in her 21 years on this earth. her mpg is atrocious. last week i went through half a tank of gas (9 gallons) in a SINGLE FUCKING DAY. any love i have had for this car has soured into resentment as she has slowly fallen into pieces. there is not a single part in her that doesn’t need replacing. hell, i could spend another 5k and maybe get another half a year out of her, MAYBE, but its just NOT WORTH IT. 

Here’s the facts. I am currently finishing up an unpaid internship that will not end for a month and a half. I have a job lined up, but I have made non-refundable plans to fly home for three weeks after my internship is over. That means I have no money coming in for over two months. I’m also planning on starting college, and will have to start apartment hunting in about 6 months, which will both add additional financial strain. I have about $2000 in savings, and my grandpa and dad have both offered $500 each to help with a down payment, and my grandpa has offered to cosign on a loan. this is all incredibly generous of them both and i’m very grateful but…they do say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 

Anyways, in preperation for this day, I have been browsing the local used car markets to get an idea of what is out there. FBM, ksl, carmax, the like. I was looking for cars in the $1,500-2,000 range and had seen a lot of really good deals for the price, but my dad dismissed that completely when i talked to him over the phone this morning. he gave me very specific (and unrealistic if you ask me) perimeters. he insisted that i look for subaru outbacks, no older than 2010, within the 4,000-5,000 range. I find a couple that are not bad, but for that price theres usually SOMETHING wrong with them. i stumbled on a great little 2003 forester that had clearly been loved and well taken care of. its clean, the engine is in remarkably good shape. it has 220k miles and is only $2,225. i kinda fell in love with it but my dad insists its a bad investment. 

Anyways next day i was telling my grandpa (who i live with) about the couple potential options id found. He didn’t like any of them and decided to give me his own (even more unrealistic) perimeters on what to look for. 2010 or newer, $5,000-8,000 range, less than 100k miles. I somehow found a couple that

One that i thought had potential was a 2008 Outback and has taken great care of her car and put a lot of money into keep it in good shape. She has records of all the work done. Its clean, comes with a new spare tire and also what i estimate is ~$350 in tools and emergency supplies. Another solid find but apparently nothing but a clean title will do so it doesnt affect his credit score. Which is valid, but…SOMETHING has to give, here.

I tell him so and he decides that the thing that has to give is the PRICE. He ups it to $10,000. I’m not necessarily a fan but he’s cosigning so ok. I don’t really find anything good online so he decides its time to go do a dealership.

We find a subaru dealership and they have an 2013 outback listed for…$11,000. yippee. He also shows us a 2017 forester listed for $14,444 and oh whoops how convenient the outback actualy already has a deposit on it. But now my grandpa is  genuinely considering this almost $15,000 car!

Just two days ago i would have said $5,000 is too much. how the hell did we get here??? Probably because my granddather is a remarkably successful businessman and also incredibly persuasive. And, unfortunately, I am too uneducated about finances and probably too trusting in the intelligence of a 84 year old so i was more or less going along with it. 

We left to run errands and planned to come back later. He’s talking about $200 monthly payments (for SIX YEARS???) and actually finalizing right fucking then and my dumb ass was just going along with it. Luckily the salesman was taking someone else on a test drive so we went home 

My dad agrees that he’s being unreasonable, but still wants me to take out a $5,000 loan and i have an equally bad feeling about that as well. They’re approaching this like its going to be a future family car but mf i’m barely starting college! Am i crazy??????

The third route i’m considering is to take out a much smaller loan of $2,000 to get the forester. Since it matches my $2,000 in savings, plus the $500 each my dad and grandpa have offered to put towards a down payment, i’d be able to make above-minimum monthly payments right off the bat before i am even back in a position of financial stability. Feel free to tell me if this plan sucks too, i am financially illiterate and have no real idea what im talking about💀

Anyways i would LOVE ya’lls thoughts because i feel like im going insane over all this



TLDR: Car broke down, both dad and grandpa want me to take out an auto loan to buy a used subaru outback. dad says $5,000, grandpa ups it to $8,000, then $10,000, now is trying to convince me to buy a $14,000 car. I have $2,000 in savings, no pay coming in for 2 months and am about to start ONLINE college. Am i right to be wary, or would listening to them not potentially fuck me over for life?

to answer repeated questions: 
my first semester of college will be all online. I live in a small mountain town with NO public transportation to speak of and no close by amenities. The closest grocery store isn’t even technically in MY town, but the one we are a tiny offshoot from. I cannot live without a car as i will have no way of taking care of myself and will be stranded in the house. i do technically live with my grandparents but they are constantly gone for weeks at a time. I cannot go to work without a car. I cannot leave the house without a car. If i could manage without one i would but it is genuinely not an option in my current situation. my current car was in absolutely terrible, borderline unsafe to drive shape even before this past week. she is a 20 year old tboned salvage title my dad bought for 2k 8 years ago. girl has 250,000 miles under her belt and not a single reliably working part to her name with the breaking point issue being bad catalytic converters for the THIRD time. she has reached the end, simple as that. 

Also i live in utah. Lots of mountains, shitty cracked roads, harsh winters. subarus arent the best, but around here they are the goat. 


UPDATE: Talked to my mom, who ironed out some misunderstandings. This isn’t meant to be a big financial burden. They are willing to cover the monthly payments until i’m able to start my job. They are also willing to take over if my finances ever get too strained. Its more about me starting to build good credit, and while i will be doing everything i can to take care of the payments alone as it is MY car, they will always step in if i can’t. I was also able to somewhat reason with my grandpa on his expectations. i found a 2012 subaru forester with 94k miles for $8k. The monthly payment is estimated at $150 which totally works with my projected budget. the dealership has a really solid reputation. i’m optimistic!","[2000.0, 500.0, 1500.0, 2225.0, 5000.0, 350.0, 10000.0, 11000.0, 14444.0, 15000.0, 5000.0, 200.0, 5000.0, 2000.0, 2000.0, 500.0, 5000.0, 8000.0, 10000.0, 14000.0, 2000.0, 8.0, 150.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ejp3rh/am_i_crazy_or_are_the_adults_in_my_life_pushing/

Anyone can do some, or all, of these things. ***edited to address somr of thr most common comments i am getting :)

Clarity - I am in Canada not the USA. I am a female.  Late 20's. Small rural community on an island. 

In my early 20's I made many foolish decisions financially. I grew up poor and didn't know anything about money. Now that I am in my later 20's I am paying the price. Literally. 
So I started working on ways to save money, make more money, make my life simpler, live within my means, and work towards eliminating a certain portion of my debt and possibly consolidating the rest in a debt counseling program.
But mainly what this post is about are some simple ways to help people get started, or make a difference.
Maybe you have thought of some already, maybe not, but if this helps anyone out even a little, then it is worth my time typing it up!

In no particular order, these are some steps I have taken since the beginning of 2016. For clarity, I am a Canadian woman. 

~switched to a no-fees bank account, that also pays interest. So I save money, and I make a little extra from the interest. Every dollar counts. 
My old bank was charging me $14.95/month for my checking and savings account. No interest paid. Charged for checks, and charged for services such as a Stop Payment.
My new bank (Tangerine) charges $0/month for my checking and savings. They pay a small amount of interest on balances in checking and savings. First book of checks are free. 1 free stop payment a year.
Overall this saves me about $200 a year give or take. And i am not sure what the interest will be but more than 0 so it is good.

~Called both of my credit card companies and asked for the lowest possible interest rate. Both were able to do so. 
Card #1 lowered my interest rate from 19% down to 11%. 
Card #2 lowered my interest rate from 19% to 11.9% with a once yearly fee of $60. Just goes to show you it never hurts to ask. Communication is key. ***Most companies would rather help you, or make a payment agreement with you, than pursue your account and send it to collections <---- they will lose money if they do this.

~Went meatless. Look it's not that hard. It is so much less expensive. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cheaper than meat where I live. Yes I get more than enough protein and I am incredibly healthy and fit. I can make many delicious meals. 
You also tend to spend less going out to eat because there aren't as many options. This is a good thing. Good for your health and your wallet. No fast food. No chain restaurants. I REALIZE THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE OK THANK YOU :) but it can help some people.

~Sell items I don't need or want. 2 Lululemon hoodies. Dirtbike gear that I likely would not use again. Etc. Used the money for sensible things like groceries and my overdue credit card bill.

~Get a cheaper cell phone plan! Another one of those ""at least you can ask"" scenarios where your provider may give you a deal if you've been a customer for a long time. If they don't, shop around until you find a good deal. The BEST times of the year to do this are ""back to school"" (late aug - late sept), or Black Friday (this is usually a whole weekend of deals in store and online), and Christmas. Often $0 phone deals, good plans, extra data especially around back to school. You can also search online for deals.

~this one may not be for everyone but I needed a bed, and I did a lot of research... ended up buying a hammock and a stand instead of a mattress and frame. OK WAIT. I know it sounds odd but... the whole setup was $250, *edit - i checked my receipts and it was $166.87 CAD. It saved me a lot of money. & my back is fine thank you to the many commenter who were concerned about that. But there are entire countries where a hammock is normal for a bed and they all can still walk and function. I appreciate the concern however. Thank you all.

~take people up on their offers to help. Really, my friends and family have been great. They often offer help (I don't mean give me money) and I rarely take it. But this year I am trying to change my ways. A friend offered me a few months rent free in his apartment. It's fully furnished except the bedroom I'd be in. I accepted and am eternally grateful. For my birthday my dad offered instead of a tangible gift (I didn't want gifts anyways, and I am trying to cut down on ""stuff"") that he would pay off the remaining $500 on a student loan I took out in 2007 and had paid down from $10,000 down to $500 in 2016. That loan is now eliminated completely from my monthly bills.  This also isn't for everyone.

~Cancel your gym/yoga/pilates/karate memberships. You can do almost any workout at home using your computer and YouTube. Its free. I'm assuming you have the internet of course, but most do You can also make a one time investment in a dvd or two if you don't want to use up data or you'd rather use a TV and can't hook up your phone or laptop to it. You can fill old milk jugs with water and use them like kettlebells. You can do squats, lunges, jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, yoga, planks, and much more without any equipment at all. Maybe a mat and again that would be a 1 time investment. Sometimes if you can't cancel the agreement you can transfer it to someone else. I have done this in the past using Kijiji. This will save you on average $50/month, or $600/year. IF YOU ARE A GYM LOVER I GET IT OKAY :) You don't have to do this - I hope to re open a member ship when I can. It is a temporary money saving tactic for me. Best of luck on your gainz.

~Assess your car insurance. I went in to renew my insurance and was able to get it from $140/month to $109/month. I could save even more ($29 finance fee & %2.5 interest) if I purchased the insurance all at once, and didn't pay through monthly installments, but I do not have that much cash set aside unfortunately. ***This reinforces the often pointed out fact in Personal Finance threads that having personal savings is just as important as paying down debt.

~Get a 2nd part time job. I am working 2 jobs with strange hours right now. So I have applied for 2 jobs in the hopes of getting another (3rd)one to supplement my income. One of the jobs is a part time overnight stock position - not terribly exciting or rewarding BUT it is not forever and it is extra money. The other job is only for 2 months but it pays well, working for the Federal Census (big survey Canada does to discover info about demographics). Fingers crossed. If I get neither of these positions then I will continue to apply for other similar ones and work as much as I can in my original job as well. So I am trying to bring in extra money. 

~change the way you give gifts. I am trying to give people less ""stuff""... consume less. So I sometimes make a donation to the SPCA in the name of the gift recipient. Or to a cause close to that person's heart depending on their individual personalities and life experiences. Or I buy some groceries and we make a meal together. Or have an ""everyone bring 10 bucks"" party and order as much vegetarian take out we can get with the total. (may have to adjust a bit depending on where you live but you get my drift) this is also not for everyone I get that. My circle is ok with this. Not everyone will be in the same boat. 

~make an honest budget. get out your calculator. Make all those columns and lines. Fill in every little thing. All your bills. All your vices. How much do you really spend on groceries? (Hint - look back through 1 month of bank statements, you can do that on any banking app, any mobile website for your bank, any paper bank statement) How much cash? where does it go? Gas stations for fuel? Get areal clear picture. It will help you. Remember, keep 10% minimum of every paycheck aside in a savings account for you - whichever one will give you the highest interest rate while still allowing you access to your funds (and I always have a few rolls of loonies and a few 20's stashed as well just in case) and incorporate that into your budget.

~consider seeing a non profit debt counselor. They can often help you lower or eliminate your interest and other fees, consolidate your debt into one monthly payment instead of spreading your money between all your debts and trying to just make the minimum payment on everything. *Note - some debts, such as student loans, are not eligible for this service. Please do the appropriate research.

~stay away from shopping malls and TV. Malls make you want ot spend money. Don't go places where the temptation will be great. TV commercials make you want to spend money. They are designed to do so. You don't need any of that crap. It is not as important as what you are saving and working so hard for. Opening your own business. Taking a program at College. Going on a trip. Being debt free. All of these things are more important than a new shirt or the latest shoes or KFC or the latest cell phone...

~Walk more. I have a car. But I live within a reasonable walk to a Loblaws Superstore (kind of like Wal Mart for those of you not in Canada) & a pet supply store (for dog food). Save the gas. Save the wear & tear on your car.

~if you're partnered, do free or very cheap dates. Fly kites somewhere cool. If you don't have a beach you might have a cliff or the roof of a bulding... flat roof... haha. Make a craft. Have a cook-off. Go for a walk where 1 of you is blindfolded and the other one has to guide you over obstacles. Do chin ups on the monkey bars. Go to an open mic night for music and atmosphere. Read aloud on the beach. Go for a drive somewhere to watch the sun set. Write down your goals and then burn them off a candle flame into the wind. You know just think outside of the box.
 (I am single and not interested in dating for a while when I'm sorting out my life so idk just suggestions)

Most of all just don't give up and keep making changes in small ways and you will get there. I was so hopeless a year ago and now I am starting to feel better. Things are starting to look up. I am still in a huge amount of debt but now I have made a dent in it and have a plan to continue doing so. I am able to sleep better at night knowing I am really doing everything I can think of to make my situation better and I am constantly looking for new ways and new ideas. 
Like I said not everyone can do all of these things but everyone can do at least 1 or 2 of these things, even right now, today, after reading this, you can do some of these things right away. Don't procrastinate. And keep your chin up.
=)

First, I want to iterate that I do recognize how fortunate and privileged I am to be able to achieve this milestone. I am extremely lucky to have been born without any major disabilities or health issues, and I am very grateful to be able to participate in a society where the opportunities and resources to achieve personal successes exist. Furthermore, I believe I was lucky to have been born into extreme poverty, for it ignited a fire within me to do everything within my power to escape my circumstances. I refused to allow my situation to define me, and I focused my time & energy on the things within my influence to improve my life.

Because I grew up in poverty, I've held a job in some form or fashion since I was 10 years old. The ones I worked in my youth were tedious and low paying, but they taught me to not be afraid of hard work. They also motivated me to find better & higher paying jobs, and to that end I pursued getting my education since I lacked any special gifts or talents for earning a lot of money easily. My youth was not like that of most people I know. It was comprised entirely of school, work, and study. There was little time for leisure, and even during school breaks I would borrow books for the subsequent semester to get a jumpstart on the material. Thankfully the effort paid off, and I was able to do well enough in school to qualify for some scholarships for college. I went to the cheapest institution I could find, and when choosing a major, I decided to pursue engineering as it suited my strengths in math & science *and* offered careers with higher earning potential, as opposed to one that simply followed my passion (art).

Upon graduating college (with around $10k in student loans), I landed my first professional job, which paid a handsome annual salary of $28k. I continued living intentionally and aligned my actions to my values & priorities. As Dave Ramsey is known for saying, ""live like no one else now, so later you can live like no one else"". I was accustomed to living in poverty, so I knew how to survive on a lean budget. Achieving a financially stable and secure life was more important and rewarding to me than stuff I could accumulate or luxurious experiences I could buy, which allowed me to avoid the YOLO mentality and FOMO mindset. Also, as a Gen X-er, I started my career in an era of disappearing pensions and the advent of outsourcing/offshoring. I watched good paying, stable jobs disappear overnight, and loyal, long term employees left suddenly without the incomes and secure retirements they had come to expect. That motivated me to treat my income like lottery winnings, and maximize my savings rate to ensure that I never had to worry about relying on a job for survival or face the prospect of being in poverty again.

I wasn't the most knowledgeable investor, and didn't learn about low cost passive index funds until my late 30s. However, I was fortunate to work for a company early on in my career that explained the power of compounding and the benefits of tax advantaged savings, which encouraged me to participate in my 401k program. I knew I had a long investing time horizon, which helped me to develop a high risk tolerance and feel comfortable with putting most of my contributions into equities. I ignored short term market volatility (which many of my coworkers had trouble handling during the 2000 and 2008 recessions, to their unfortunate detriment), and as I gained work experience & skills I strategically job hopped to pursue higher income opportunities. I looked for jobs with solid 401k benefits, such as low fees and generous employer matching, so that I could continue to take advantage of that savings vehicle.

Achieving any long term goal requires consistency and discipline, and the ability to break it down and attack it one small bite at a time--while keeping an eye on the larger prize. It's no different for finances, and each of us has to decide if it's worth making some trade offs today in order to have a brighter and more abundant tomorrow. I've had some people tell me that it's important to enjoy the present, as there is no guarantee that there will be a tomorrow. However, the reality is that tomorrow will likely come for most of us, so it's prudent to plan for it.","[10.0, 28.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7l3fuy/this_is_what_can_happen_if_you_contribute_to_your/
t5_2qstm,"If you're worried about digging yourself out of a hole starting, start now. The difference one year makes.","If you're worried about digging yourself out of a hole starting, start now. The difference one year makes. January of 2014 I freaked out. I was past due on my car payment and credit cards. I was making minimums on everything (despite making a very good salary). and constantly broke. I had about $2,000 in my savings+checking accounts combined. My credit score had tanked to 580. I was sitting around 85% CC utilization. I was at my wits end. I'd started avoiding opening bills, looking at statements (or even my bank account balances) out of fear. I did not answer calls from unknown numbers, because while my iPhone didn't know who was calling, I sure did. I was not in control.  
  
I got my shit in order. Things had to change. I put myself on a budget, added all my accounts to Mint, and began using the spare money at the end of each month to pay off credit cards instead of blowing it on something I wouldn't care about the next day. Meals were prepped at home and taken to work, happy hours were cut down to a beer or two (and no more rounds on me), and it became almost a game; how much money can I shove into debt and savings this month?   
  
  
Today, just over one year later, everything is current. I'm at 27% utilization on my cards. I have a safety net of $12,000 in my savings account. My credit score, as of this morning, is 696. Four of my credit cards have auto-increased my limits. On top of that, I managed to take a vacation to Hawaii for 5 days, paying entirely in cash (no longer will I be a slave to credit cards - I use them responsibly for their rewards, pay them in full, and everything else gets paid in cash). Yes, my credit snafus are still on my report. They are falling off one by one. This will take time, but the process is in motion.

t5_2qstm,"Car broke down as I was saving to buy a new one, now in a pickle.","Car broke down as I was saving to buy a new one, now in a pickle. Hi,

I've been driving my old beater 2003 CTS for years now. I've been saving for a downpayment on a new car but due to a rainy day last month I had to use all my savings.

I have $1500 earmarked for a downpayment for a new car right now and planned on buying one in January. Yesterday my car wouldn't start. I had expected this as I knew the starter was most likely on its way out so I took my spare starter and had my car towed to a repair shop where I learned that the damage was much more severe than I imagined. There was a lot more that needed replacing than just the starter and the total for all repairs came out to ~$4k. I'm not that interested in paying 80% of my car's value in repairs while also setting myself back again when it comes to buying a new car.

My office is in a part of town where the buses that run through don't start until after I need to get to work and unless I leave work early won't be able to catch one home. I live 30 minutes from work. 

I've been looking into what cars I should buy and honestly am at a little loss. I've never bought a car before besides my CTS and I want to buy something that will last me a long time. The car market, however, is slightly strange at least in my area. Every used car I can find is somewhat to significantly more expansive than a new car! The car I'm most interested in is a civic but at this point I will take anything. I'm not interested in buying a cheap beater just for me to have to repeat this process again but at the same time buying a new car feels wrong to me.

I can afford something decent. I make $60k/yr, my rent is $2.1k (HCOL), my car insurance is only $140. 

Ideally my plan in 2023 was to buy a new car and rent cheaper/get a roommate/move in with my SO which would generally bring my rent down from $2k to something like $800-1100.  I planned on buying a new car as I can afford it and for the past 5 years have been stressed out over this beater I drive and really want something reliable that I don't need to constantly worry about and rack up repair costs. 

My problem is that the car I was hoping to last until January died earlier than I thought it would. I can afford car payments but I want to have sizable downpayment even something like $5k would be nice as it would lower my monthly.

My credit score is 650 (jumped on the credit building train late, started off with medical debt I was unaware of, I thought that should be wiped but it's still affecting my credit score)

I am not old enough to rent a car in my state.

I would appreciate any advice. This is uncharted waters for me and I don't have any family and friends to really lean on. I've been wondering if a credit union would be a good option but either way I need a car sooner rather than later.","[1500.0, 4.0, 60.0, 2.0, 140.0, 2.0, 800.0, 5.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/yx0ypj/car_broke_down_as_i_was_saving_to_buy_a_new_one/
t5_2qstm,Should I pay off my current auto loan now?,"Should I pay off my current auto loan now? Hey everybody, I am undecided on what is best for me at the current moment and would like some help. I am in the process of making monthly payments on my auto loan for my truck. I have been making payments since June of 2022 and would like to pay it off sooner rather than later. I have roughly $4100 left on the loan and I am able to pay it all off right now if I wanted to with no issues. I am planning on buying a new truck within the next couple weeks (possibly trading my current one in) and would like to know if it is a good idea to pay the loan off as soon as possible. I have read that paying off an auto loan this early could actually hurt my credit score. What are my current options and what would be the best possible solution?

t5_2qstm,Sheriff house auction buyer beware! We are losing the house but have to continue paying a mortgage for no house.,"Sheriff house auction buyer beware! We are losing the house but have to continue paying a mortgage for no house. My wife and I bought a house at the sherrif’s auction January 2020 with a secured loan from the bank. We recieved the deed from the sherrif’s auction. We began to fix the house up. Consisting up tearing up flooring, replacing windows, painting the entire house, fixing walls and ceilings. When we went to get the abstract we found out there was a second lien on the property not disclosed when purchased at the auction.

We got a lawyer and the lawyer attempted to contact the bank with the second lien. The bank could not find any loan for this property. A couple of months later we have a guy walk in the house to inspect and change the house locks. We continued to work on the house with the okay from the lawyer. Another notice was left on our house detailing it was empty. Our lawyer said to continue working on the house and it will just take time. This went on for an entire year.

About last month we get notified from bank 2 that we either pay the second lien that is owed or they will take the house and put it back on the sheriff’s auction. The amount owed is around $114,000 not including the loan we already have of the house. Our options came down to paying bank 2 to go away or have the house taken. We attempted to negotiate and offered 50k. Bank 2 gave no response and told us they will be putting it in the auction soon. My wife and I decided to offer 100k and was turned down by bank 2. It was reported by our lawyer that bank 2 said they were going to be putting it on the auction again because they can get more money. Our options come down to continuing to negotiate with the bank in hopes they’ll go away or lose the house and continue to pay a house loan for no house. Our offer of 100k was already pushing it so at this point we’re out of options. My goal is to bring awareness and help other people not get in this same situation. I am currently working on a video that details all of this along with before and after pictures/videos of the house.

Thank you for reading.

Edit. Added one more sentence to the TLDR

Edit2: this happend in Iowa,USA. My mother law in law took out the secured loan then it was going to be switched to my wife and I after we fix up the house. This “plan” was recommended to use by our bank who gave us the secured loan. 

Edit 3: currently at work but i’ll try and answer you guys as soon as I can and provide more info. 

Edit 4: I used the word “mortgage “ but it’s not. I’m not very knowledgeable in this area. To clarify my mil got a secured loan from the bank using her house as collateral as recommended by our bank. After we fixed the house some, the loan would then be transferred to my wife and I. We would then start a mortgage. 

Edit 5- anyone know a good place to upload our before and after video? Some expressed wanting to see it but I don’t believe I can include it in this sub. 

Edit 6- Some have pointed out Iowa does not have title insurance. My mil has looked into other real estate lawyers and has had no luck. 

Edit7- The video is now live. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qApAx9McdG0

Edit 8- Last update can be found here.

TLDR: Bought a house on sheriff's auction that needed a lot of work. Worked on the house after we bought it. Found out months later there was a second lien. Bank will be taking our house due to failure to pay for second lien ($110,000+) from previous owners that was undisclosed when we bought it. We will have to continue paying for a mortgage for no house.

t5_2qstm,Is it better to pay off our debt or file for bankruptcy if we want to buy a house ASAP?,"Is it better to pay off our debt or file for bankruptcy if we want to buy a house ASAP? My husband prior to the pandemic had a very  comfortable job and he made good money. We had good savings and a great credit score but unfortunately he was laid off at the beginning of the pandemic. We were able to pay down most of our debt and keep ourselves afloat but he was unable to find work and by the end of the year we had our car get repossessed and I had about 10K worth of credit card debt go into collection. My husband was finally rehired at the same company and is making good money again. We have very minimal bills right now and we are quickly growing our savings. We want to buy a house sooner than later as we currently live on my parent's property, we have our own home here but would like more space and our own property. We've been avoiding looking at a credit but bit the bullet and discovered mine is 473 with 10K in collections and 9 negative accounts. My husband's is 505 with only $350 in collections but our car was charged off for $35K and he has two negative accounts. Prior to this our credit history and payment history was exceptional. We are wondering if filing for bankruptcy and ""starting over"" or just paying off the debt itself would get us into our own home quicker.","[350.0, 35.0]",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/r2cc5p/is_it_better_to_pay_off_our_debt_or_file_for/
